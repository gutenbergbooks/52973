<p>Sicut Augustinus docet, in hujusmodi qu&aelig;stionibus duo sunt observanda.
Primo quidem ut Veritas Scriptur&aelig; inconcusse teneatur. Secundo, cum Scriptura
Divina multipliciter exponi possit, quod nulli expositioni aliquis ita
pr&aelig;cise inh&aelig;reat, ut si certa ratione constiterit hoc esse falsum quod aliquis
sensum Scriptur&aelig; esse credebat, id nihilominus asserere pr&aelig;sumat; ne Scriptura
ex hoc ab infidelibus derideatur, et ne eis via credendi pr&aelig;cludatur.</p>

<p>As Augustine teacheth, there are two things to be observed in questions
of this kind. First, that the truth of Scripture be inviolably maintained.
Secondly, since Divine Scripture may be explained in many ways, that no one
cling to any particular exposition with such pertinacity that, if what he supposed
to be the teaching of Scripture should turn out to be plainly false, he
would nevertheless presume to put it forward; lest thereby Sacred Scripture
should be exposed to the derision of unbelievers, and the way of salvation
should be closed to them.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span> progress of modern Science has given rise to
not a few objections against the truths of Revelation.
And of these there is none which seems to have
taken such a firm hold of the public mind in
England, and, indeed, throughout Europe generally, as that
which is derived from the interesting and startling discoveries
of Geology. Accordingly, when I was engaged,
some years ago, in explaining and defending the Evidences
of Revealed Religion, I found myself brought face to face
with Geological phenomena and Geological speculations.</p>

<p>It was plainly impossible to consider, in a candid and philosophical
spirit, the argument with which I had to deal, so
long as I remained ignorant of the evidence on which it was
based. I resolved, therefore, to make myself familiar with
the leading principles and the leading facts of Geology. And
thus I was drawn insensibly into the study of this science; to
which I have devoted, for some years, the greater part of my
leisure hours.</p>

<p>Impressed with the conviction that no fact can be really at
variance with Revealed Truth, I determined, in the first place,
to ascertain the facts which have been brought to light by
the researches of Geologists. The general principles, which
might afterward appear to be clearly involved in these facts
when duly classified and arranged, I was fully prepared to
admit. And I hoped, in the end, to search out and discover
the harmony which, I was satisfied, must exist between conclusions
thus established and the Inspired Word of God.</p>

<p>While occupied in working out this problem for myself, it
was suggested to me that others, who had not time or opportunity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
to pursue the same line of inquiry, would, perhaps, be
glad to share in the fruits of my studies. In deference to this
suggestion I consented, not without misgivings, to write a
series of papers on Geology in its relations with Revealed
Religion, which have appeared, from time to time, in the
<i>Irish Ecclesiastical Record</i>. From the attention these papers
attracted, crude and fragmentary as they were, it soon became
evident that the question was not without interest for a large
class of readers. And I have been led to believe that a more
full and mature, but at the same time a popular, Treatise on
the subject would be a welcome accession to ecclesiastical
literature, and would supply a want that has long been felt.
Such a Treatise I have proposed to myself in the present
Volume.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Geology I wish to disclaim at the outset, all pretension
to original researches; which my opportunities did not permit,
nor the scope of my Work demand. It was not my
object to enlarge the bounds of Geological knowledge; but
rather to ascertain what that knowledge is, and to set it
before my readers in plain and simple words. For this purpose
I have had recourse to the great masters of the
science: and have endeavored to gather into a systematic
form the phenomena upon which they are all agreed; to
sketch in outline the general theory about which there is
practically no dispute; and to draw out the line of reasoning
by which, as it seems to me, this theory may be most effectively
demonstrated.</p>

<p>Exact references are given to the original authorities on all
questions of importance, and on many points even of minor
detail: partly that I might not seem to claim as my own
what belongs to others; partly that I might consult for the
convenience of those who should wish to investigate more
minutely what I have but lightly touched. And here it may
be well to observe, with regard to the two classic works of Sir
Charles Lyell, his <i>Elements</i> and his <i>Principles</i>, which have
been reproduced so many times and in so many forms, that I
have uniformly referred to the latest edition of each.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

<p>The Woodcuts which illustrate the Volume will, I venture
to hope, help to convey a clear and distinct impression of
many natural objects which can be represented but imperfectly
in words. Some of the most striking and effective are taken
from the admirable Manual of Geology brought out some
years ago by the Reverend Doctor Haughton, of Trinity
College, Dublin. My best thanks are due to the learned
author for the kindness with which he placed his Woodblocks
at my disposal. I have also to express my acknowledgments
to Sir Charles Lyell, who has allowed me to reproduce some
of the drawings that embellish his works; and to the eminent
publishers, Messrs. Bell and Daldy of London, and Mr.
Nimmo of Edinburgh, who have, with great courtesy, furnished
me with electrotypes of several figures from the works
of Doctor Mantell and Mr. Hugh Miller.</p>

<p>To my colleagues in Maynooth I am much indebted for
their judicious suggestions and friendly assistance during the
progress of the Work. In particular I desire to testify my
obligations to our distinguished Professor of Scripture, the
Reverend Doctor M’Carthy, for the unwearied kindness with
which he has allowed me to draw at pleasure on his profound
and extensive knowledge of the Sacred Text.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Molloy</span> has, in the present work, made an important
contribution to a department of scientific and theologic literature,
which has already been enriched by the labors of several
other Catholic Fathers, among whom must be mentioned
<span class="smcap">Cardinal Wiseman</span>,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> <span class="smcap">Father Perrone</span>,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> and <span class="smcap">Father
Pianciani</span>,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> who, in Italy, maintain substantially, the same
ground which, in England, has been sustained by <span class="smcap">Dr. Chalmers</span>,
<span class="smcap">Dr. Buckland</span>, <span class="smcap">Pye Smith</span>, and <span class="smcap">Hugh Miller</span>,
and we may now add with pleasure, by <span class="smcap">Dr. Molloy</span>.
Names which, in the United States, find their counterparts in
<span class="smcap">Dr. Hitchcock</span>, <span class="smcap">Prof. Silliman</span>, <span class="smcap">Prof. A. Guyot</span>, <span class="smcap">Dr.
Thompson</span>, and <span class="smcap">J. D. Dana</span>.</p>

<p>Reviewing the progress of opinion touching the relations
of Science to Revealed Religion, it is noteworthy that while
many Protestant theologians and writers on both sides of the
Atlantic have, until a recent period, treated the discoveries of
science, and especially of Geology, so far as they affect theological
dogmas, in a manner, if not of contempt, at least of
distrust or unfairness: on the contrary, the Romanist writers
who have discussed these themes, have done so, generally, in
a spirit of broad catholicity well calculated to command the
respect it merits. They have shown no sensitiveness or timidity
lest, perchance, their exegesis might be disturbed by
candidly admitting the changes demanded by the discoveries
of Science.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>The author’s discussion of the principles of Geology evinces
much familiarity both with the science and what is equally
important, the necessities of the unscientific reader. He has
presented, in the second part of his book, an interesting review,
infused by copious quotations from the Christian Fathers, from
the time of St. Augustine, showing that long before Geology
had any existence as a science, and of course, when the discussions
and doubts it has excited were unknown, the essential
points respecting Time and the order of Creation had received
careful attention from devout thinkers, and that the conclusions
at which they arrived, on purely theological grounds,
were, in most cases, much the same as those which the best
writers of our time deduce from Geological evidence.</p>

<p>It is now thirty-five years since (1835) <span class="smcap">Cardinal</span>, then <span class="smcap">Dr.
Wiseman</span>, delivered in Rome, before the English College,
of which he was the head, his Lectures, already referred to, on
the connection between Science and Religion, in the fifth and
sixth of which he considers more particularly the Geological
argument. The spirit of these lectures was a just rebuke to
the narrow bigotry of such writers as <span class="smcap">Mr. Croly</span>, <span class="smcap">Fairholm</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Granville Penn</span>, as well as certain American theologians,
who, by means of arrogance and denunciation, sought
to silence the voice of truth, as proclaimed in the language
of discovery, announcing the nature and the extent of those
changes in life and in physical development which are recorded
in the Genesis of the Rocks, because they conceived these immutable
truths must of necessity conflict with the Genesis of
Moses; the real conflict being only with their narrow interpretations.
With rare moral courage <span class="smcap">Dr. Wiseman</span> grappled
with the great questions discussed so well in his lectures, at a
time when there prevailed, with reference to such themes, a
very wide-spread distrust, even among men of moderate
opinions. In fact, the candor and courtesy displayed by <span class="smcap">Dr.
Wiseman</span> in his lectures, presents an enviable contrast to the
acrimony of many theologians, and worthy of all praise, and
in harmony with the learning and good taste which characterize
his writings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Molloy</span> is a worthy disciple of the same school, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
we are glad to find in him the same candor and liberality
which it is certainly to be hoped he will receive at the hands
of those who may differ from him. His geological arguments
and illustrations are very naturally drawn, chiefly from British
authorities. It is evident that the condition of opinion upon
these matters among religious teachers and readers in Great
Britain is less advanced than it is in this country or in
continental Europe. Our author has obviously but little
familiarity with the American literature of this subject. The
similarity in some parts of his book both in thought and
style with the writings on this subject of the late <span class="smcap">Professor
Silliman</span>, of Yale College, is quite noticeable. He has obviously
not seen the writings of <span class="smcap">Dr. Hitchcock</span>, of <span class="smcap">Guyot</span>,
of <span class="smcap">Dana</span>, and of other American writers. We have therefore
by the kind permission of the author reproduced in this edition
the chapter on <span class="smcap">Cosmogony</span> from <span class="smcap">Professor Dana’s</span>
<i>Manual of Geology</i>.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> The views set forth, in a very condensed
form, in this chapter, embrace also the ideas of <span class="smcap">Professor
Arnold Guyot</span>, of Princeton, as presented by him in
his unpublished lecture upon the same subject.</p>

<p>American readers will remember also that <span class="smcap">Professor Dana</span>
has discussed this subject much more at length in a series of
papers published in the <i>Bibliotheca Sacra</i>,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> in a review of
<span class="smcap">Dr. Tayler Lewis’s</span> <i>Six Days of Creation</i>.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> It is greatly to
be desired that <span class="smcap">Professor Dana</span> should soon make a revised
edition of his various writings upon this subject, a work which
would be received with interest on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>We do not propose here to present the bibliography of this
subject with any completeness, but we desire to mention, to
those who have not seen it, a little volume of excellent spirit by
<span class="smcap">Dr. Jos. P. Thompson</span>, of New York, entitled <i>Man in Genesis
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
and Geology</i>,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> which discusses chiefly the relations of man to
creation, in seven lectures, the first of which is an “Outline
of Creation in Genesis.” Even as we write another small volume
on this subject comes to hand under the title of <i>Chemical
History of the Six Days of Creation</i>,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> by <span class="smcap">Mr. John
Phin</span>, which also contains the substance of a series of lectures
delivered by the author, who handles his theme in a spirit
equally reverential and scientific, and well calculated to do
good.</p>

<p>Those who desire to know the best exposition of this subject
at the hands of a modern theologian will read the first
part of <span class="smcap">Dr. Lange’s</span> <i>Genesis, or the First Book of Moses</i>,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>
in <span class="smcap">Dr. Tayler Lewis’s</span> translation, pp. 159-177. The candid
and scholarly spirit of the learned authors of this work
indicates a marked change in discussions of this nature when
compared with similar literature of the last generation.</p>

<p>These few suggestions, chiefly on the American literature
of this subject, are offered in the belief that some readers
may be glad to know where to turn for similar discussions,
while <span class="smcap">Dr. Molloy</span> will certainly not misinterpret our kindly
intentions in suggesting to him some contemporary sources
of information to most of which he very probably had no
means of access when his excellent work was prepared.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Among</span> the various pursuits that engage the human
mind, there are few so attractive as Geology, none
so important as Revelation. Each of these two
studies has an interest peculiar to itself. The one is chiefly
concerned about the world in which we are living: the
other about the world to which we are hastening. Geology
leads us down into the depths of the Earth, and there,
unfolding to our view a long series of strange unwritten
records impressed on lasting monuments by the hand of
Nature, it proceeds to trace back the history of our Globe
through myriads of ages into the distant past. Revelation,
on the other hand, comes to us from above; and setting
forth the far more wonderful records of God’s dealings with
man, holds out the hope of another world “everlasting in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
the heavens”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> which shall still remain when this earth and
all the works that are therein shall have melted away with
fervent heat.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>But, it may be asked, why should two such incongruous
topics be set down for discussion side by side? To answer
this question is to explain the scope and design of the
present work. We are not going to write a Manual of
Geology; nor yet a Treatise on Revelation. Taken separately,
these two subjects have been handled with eminent
skill and ability; the one by the votaries of Science, the
other by the friends of Theology. It is our purpose to consider
them not so much in themselves as in their mutual
relations: to compare the conclusions of Geology with the
truths of Revelation; and to inquire if it be possible to
accept the one and yet not to abandon the other.</p>

<p>An uneasy apprehension has long prevailed among devout
Christians, and a declared conviction among a large
class of unbelievers, that the discoveries of Geology are
at variance with the facts recorded in the Book of Genesis.
Now, the historical narrative of Genesis lies at the very
foundation of all Revealed Religion. Hence the science
of Geology, has come to be looked on with suspicion by the
simple-minded faithful, and to be hailed with joy, as a new
and powerful auxiliary, by that infidel party which, in these
latter days, has assumed a position so bold and defiant. It
is now confidently asserted that we cannot uphold the
teaching of Revelation, unless we shut our eyes to the
evidence of Geology; and that we cannot pursue the study
of Geology, if we are not prepared to renounce our belief in
the doctrines of Revelation.</p>

<p>Vet surely this cannot be. Truth cannot be at variance
with truth. If God has recorded the history of our Globe,
as Geologists maintain, on imperishable monuments within
the Crust of the Earth, we may be quite sure He has not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
contradicted that Record in His Written Word. There
may be for a time, indeed, a conflict between the student
of Nature and the student of Revelation. Each is liable to
error when he undertakes to interpret the record that is
placed in his hands. Many a brilliant Geological theory,
received at first with unbounded applause, has been dissipated
by the progress of discovery even within the lifetime
of its author. On the other hand, it cannot be denied that
Theologians have sometimes imputed to the Bible that which
the Bible does not teach. Learned and pious men&mdash;Protestants
and Catholics alike&mdash;once believed that the Book of
Joshua represents the succession of day and night as produced
by the revolution of the Sun around the Earth:
whereas it is now considered quite plain that the Book of
Joshua, properly understood, teaches nothing of the kind;
but that the Inspired Writer, in describing a wonderful phenomenon
of Nature, simply employs the language of men
according to the established usage of his time. We need
not wonder, therefore, that a conflict of opinion should
sometimes arise between the Geologist and the Theologian;
but a conflict there cannot be between the story which God
has described on His works and the story He has recorded
in His Written Word.</p>

<p>Though we come forward, therefore, among those whose
duty and whose glory it is to uphold Revelation, we are by
no means jealous of the wonderful ardor, and we may add,
the wonderful success, with which the study of Geology has
been lately pursued. We have too much confidence in the
truth of our cause to apprehend that it can suffer in any
way from the progress of Natural Science. It is our conviction,
rather, that the more thoroughly the works of Nature
are understood, the more perfectly they will be found
to harmonize with the truths of Revelation. We are not
afraid, therefore, to venture into the realms of Geology and
to come face to face with its discoveries. Too long, perhaps,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
has this interesting and popular science been neglected
by those who are ranged under the banner of Religion.
Let it be ours to show that the study of God’s works
is not incompatible with the belief in God’s Word; and
that it is quite possible to investigate the ancient history of
the world we inhabit without forfeiting our right to a better.</p>

<p>The points of contact between Geology and Revelation
are chiefly these two:&mdash;First, the Antiquity of the Earth;
Secondly, the Antiquity of the Human Race. In the present
Volume we shall confine our attention to the Antiquity
of the Earth. The subject that offers itself for discussion
may be stated in a few words. Geologists maintain that
the Crust of the Earth has been slowly built up by means
of a long series of operations which would require hundreds
of thousands, perhaps millions of years for their accomplishment:
whereas the Bible narrative, it is alleged, allows
but the short lapse of six or eight thousand years from the
creation of the world to the present time. The Geological
record, then, seems to contradict the Mosaic; and the question
is, how this apparent contradiction is to be explained.</p>

<p>Some have ventured to solve the problem by rejecting
the historical narrative of the Bible: others by ignoring the
plain facts of Geology. But there is a third class of writers,
including many names of the highest eminence and authority,
who contend that we may admit the extreme Antiquity
of our Globe, which Geology so imperatively demands,
without compromising in the smallest degree the truthfulness
of the Mosaic story. They say that the Chronology of
the Bible stops short with Adam, and does not go back to
the beginning of the world. By means of the data which
the Bible supplies we may calculate, at least roughly, the
lapse of time from the Creation of Adam to the Birth of
Christ. But from the first beginning of all created things,
when God made the Heavens and the Earth, to the close of
the Sixth Day when Adam was introduced upon the scene,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
that is an interval which, in the Bible narrative, is left altogether
undefined and uncertain. This is the view which
we hope to develop and to illustrate in the course of the
following pages.</p>

<p>Our task naturally divides itself into two parts. First, it
will be our duty to consider the received theory of Geology,
and to examine in detail some of the interesting and wonderful
phenomena on which it is founded. This course of
investigation, while it is plainly indispensable for the intelligent
appreciation of our subject, cannot fail at the same
time to unfold many new and striking views of the Power,
and the Goodness, and the Providence of God. “For the
invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are
clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made;
even His eternal Power and Godhead.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>In the Second Part we shall consider the Antiquity of the
Earth in reference to the History of Genesis. It will be
our purpose to show that, as far as the Bible narrative is
concerned, an interval of countless ages may have elapsed
between the first creation of the Heavens and the Earth and
the beginning of the Six Mosaic Days. Furthermore, we
shall contend that, without any prejudice to the Sacred
History, we may suppose these Days themselves to have
been, not days in the ordinary sense of the word, but long
and indefinite Periods of Time. If we succeed in establishing
these views, it will be obvious to infer that, while
the Bible enables us to determine, at least by approximation,
the Age of the Human Race, it allows time without
limit for the past history of the Earth.

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span> object of Geology is to examine and record
the appearances presented by the Crust of the Earth;
and by the aid of these appearances, to trace out
the long series of events by which it has been brought into
its present condition. Geology, therefore, like all other
natural sciences, is made up partly of fact, and partly of
theory. It belongs to the Geologist first to investigate the
phenomena which the Crust of the Earth exhibits to the eye.
For this purpose he descends into the mine and the quarry;
he visits the lofty cliff by the sea-shore, the deep ravine on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
the mountain side, the cutting of a railway; in a word,
every spot where a section of the Earth’s Crust is exposed
to view, either by the action of Nature or by the hand of
man. He then retires into the silence of his closet, with
his note-book and his specimens; and there, having arranged
and classified the various phenomena which he has already
examined with his eyes in the outer world, he proceeds to
make his deductions, and to build up his theory. He seeks
to explain how materials, so diverse in their composition,
have come to be piled up together, with such admirable
order, and yet with such endless variety; and how the solid
rocks have come to be the repository of petrified trees and
plants and bones and shells, which seem, as it were, to start
up from their graves, and to tell strange stories of a bygone
world.</p>

<p>In the early days of Geology there were comparatively
few who devoted themselves with patient industry to the
collection and classification of facts: while the number was
legion of those who, with a very meagre knowledge of facts,
set themselves to build up systems. A vast multitude of
different and conflicting theories were, in this way, brought
into existence, and attracted for a time much public attention,
each one being vehemently defended by its friends and
as vehemently assailed by its enemies. These theories resting
on no solid foundation, could not hold their ground
against the advancing tide of new discoveries. They flourished
for a brief space, and then gave way to others scarcely
more substantial, which were destined in their turn to be
likewise rejected and forgotten. Thus it came to pass,
from the manifest instability of its principles, that Geology
was long held in light repute, and practical men set little
store by its boasted discoveries and startling revelations.</p>

<p>But it would be unjust and unphilosophical to condemn
the modern theory of Geologists because of their past errors.
We must judge of this science, not according to what
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
it once was in the feebleness of its infancy, but according
to what it now is in the growing strength of its mature years.
It seems to be in the nature of things that groundless speculations
and wild conjectures go before, and sober Science
follows in their wake. The visionary dreams of the Alchemist
led the way to the science of Chemistry, and the
idle fancies of the Astrologist have given place to the marvellous
discoveries of Astronomy. So, too, amidst the confused
mass of conflicting arguments and opinions, by which
the phenomena of Geology were for a long time enveloped
and obscured, the seeds of a new science were slowly germinating.
New facts were eagerly sought after to support
or to impugn the favorite theory of the hour; and though
theory after theory passed away, yet the facts remained. In
course of time this accumulation of facts became broad and
deep and solid enough to form a sound basis for inductive
reasoning; and thus almost within our own days Geology
may be fairly said to have assumed the rank and dignity of
a science.</p>

<p>During the last quarter of a century it has been studied
with a more ardent enthusiasm than, perhaps, any other
science in England, in France, in Germany, and in America.
It has been studied, too, upon better principles than
before: less attention has been paid to the building up of
theories, and far more pains and labor have been expended
on the careful investigation of natural phenomena. There
are still, no doubt, different schools of Geologists which are
divided among themselves as regards many important details
of theory; but there are some general conclusions upon
which all Geologists are substantially agreed, and which,
they assure us, are established by evidence that is absolutely
irresistible. It is to these conclusions we wish to invite the
attention of our readers; for they bear very closely on the
question of the Antiquity of the Earth.</p>

<p>Geologists tell us, then, that the materials of which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
Earth’s Crust is composed, are not heaped together in a confused
mass, but are disposed with evident marks of definite
and systematic arrangement. This is an important truth,
of which many examples are familiar to us all, though perhaps
we do not all attend to their significance. Thus in a
quarry, we see commonly enough first a bed of limestone,
then above that a bed of gravel, and higher still a bed of
clay: and even the limestone itself is not usually a compact
mass, but is arranged in successive layers, something
like the successive courses of masonry in a building. Now
it appears that a very large proportion of the Earth’s Crust
is made up in this way of successive layers, or <i>strata</i>, as
they are called by Geologists. These <i>strata</i> are composed
of various substances, such as clay, chalk, sand, lime, and
coal; and they present everywhere the same general appearances.
They are known under the common name of Aqueous
Rocks,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> because it is believed that they were originally
formed under water; and here it is that the professors of
Geology first come into collision with the popular notions
that formerly prevailed.</p>

<p>They hold that these stratified rocks were not arranged as
we see them now, when the Earth first came from the hands
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
of its Creator, but have been formed, during the lapse of
unnumbered ages, by the operation of natural causes.
Nay more, they have divided the rocks into sundry classes,
and they undertake to explain the particular process by
which each several variety has been produced. First in
order and importance are those which derive their existence
from the mechanical force of moving water. The materials
of which they are composed first existed in the form of
minute particles, which were transported by the action of
water from one place to another; then they were spread out
over a given surface, just as we now see layers of sand, or
mud, or gravel deposited near the mouths of rivers, or in
the estuaries of the sea, or even upon the land itself during
temporary inundations. Lastly, after a long interval came
the slow but certain process of consolidation. The fine
sand was cemented together and became sandstone; the
loose gravel by a similar process was transformed into a
solid mass, known by the name of Conglomerate or Pudding-stone;
while the soft mud by simple pressure was converted
into a kind of slaty clay, called Shale. Thus from
age to age Nature was ever building up new strata, and
consolidating the old.</p>

<p>Next in order are the Aqueous Rocks, which owe their
origin to the agency of chemical laws. To this class belong
many of our limestone formations. Large quantities of
carbonate of lime are held in solution by water charged
with carbonic acid gas: when the carbonic acid, in course
of time, passes off, the carbonate of lime can no longer be
held in solution, and it is accordingly precipitated in a solid
form to the bottom. In this manner was formed that peculiar
kind of limestone called Travertine, which abounds in
Italy, and which is well known to all who have visited
Rome, as the stone of which the Coliseum was built. A
still more familiar example, on a small scale, is seen in
the case of Stalactites and Stalagmites. Water saturated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
with carbonic acid trickles down the sides, or drops from
the roof of a limestone cavern. In its course it dissolves
carbonate of lime, and holds it in solution; afterward,
reaching the floor of the cavern, it slowly evaporates and
leaves behind it a thin sheet of limestone which is called a
Stalagmite; while the icicle-like pendants that are formed
by a similar process, on the roof of the cavern, are called
Stalactites.</p>

<p>There is a third class of Aqueous Rocks which are supposed
to be made up almost exclusively of the fragmentary
remains of plants and animals, and are therefore called
Organic. The well-known coral reefs, so dreaded by the
sailor in tropical seas, are believed to be nothing more than
a mass of stony skeletons belonging to the minute marine
animalcules known among zoologists as Polyps or Zoophytes.
These little creatures, existing together in countless
multitudes, extract carbonate of lime from the waters
of the ocean in which they dwell, and by the action of
their living organs, convert it into a solid frame or skeleton,
which is called coral. From generation to generation the
same process has been going on during the long succession
of Geological ages; and huge masses of coral rock, hundreds
of miles in length, have thus been slowly built up
from fathomless depths of the ocean to within a few feet of
its surface. Our vast coal formations, on the other hand,
afford a ready example of rocks which are chiefly composed
of vegetable remains.</p>

<p>So much for the Aqueous or Stratified Rocks. Geology
next brings before us another and a very different group, of
which the origin is ascribed to fire, and which are consequently
designated by the title of Igneous Rocks. In
their general appearance they are chiefly distinguished from
the former by the absence of regular stratification; but they
are, nevertheless, intersected by numerous planes of division,
or joints, as they are called, and thus divided into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
blocks of various size and form. Geologists believe that
these rocks were at one time reduced to a molten state by
the action of intense heat, and afterward allowed slowly to
cool and to crystallize. They are divided into two classes,
the Plutonic and the Volcanic. The Plutonic Rocks are
chiefly granite of some kind or another; and though they
now often appear at the surface, they are supposed to have
been produced originally at a considerable depth within
the crust of the Earth, “or sometimes, perhaps, under
a certain weight of incumbent ocean.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> The Volcanic
Rocks have been formed at or near the surface of the
Earth, and, as the name implies, they are usually ejected,
in a state of fusion, from the fissures of an active volcano;
though not unfrequently they assume the more imposing
form of basaltic columns, as at the Giant’s Causeway in
Ireland, or on the island of Staffa near the coast of Argyleshire
in Scotland.</p>

<p>One group of rocks yet remains to be noticed. They
have been called by various names at different times, but
are now generally designated by the term Metamorphic. In
some respects they resemble the Aqueous Rocks, while, in
others, they are more nearly allied to the Igneous. Like
the former, they are stratified in their outward arrangement;
like the latter, they are more or less crystalline in their internal
texture. As to their origin, we are told that they were
first deposited under water, like the Aqueous Rocks, and
that afterward their internal structure was altered by the
agency of subterranean heat. Hence the name Metamorphic,
first suggested by Sir Charles Lyell, which conveys
the idea that these rocks have undergone a <i>change of form</i>.
To this group belong many varieties of slate, and also the
far-famed statuary marble of Italy.</p>

<p>Our readers will perceive from this brief outline that,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
if we follow the theory of Geologists, the rocks which compose
the Crust of the Earth may be conveniently divided,
according to their origin, into three leading groups, the
Aqueous, the Igneous, and the Metamorphic. The Aqueous
are formed under water, either by the mechanical force
of the water itself when in motion, or by the agency of
chemical laws, or by the intervention of organic life.
Hence they are naturally subdivided into three classes, the
Mechanical, the Chemical, the Organic. The Igneous
Rocks are produced by heat, being first melted and then
allowed to cool. When this process takes place under
great pressure in the depths of the Earth, the result is
granite; and the granite Rocks are called Plutonic: when
near the surface, through the agency of a volcano, the
Rocks so formed are called Volcanic. Lastly, the Metamorphic
Rocks are nothing else than Aqueous Rocks, of
which the texture has been altered by the action of intense
heat.</p>

<p>As regards the relative order of position amongst these
various classes of rocks, the lowest place seems uniformly
to belong to the granitic or Plutonic group. It is true that
the granite will often appear at the surface of the Earth;
but wherever there is a series of rocks piled one above the
other, the granite will always be the lowest. This assertion
is based on two broad facts; first, whenever we get to the
bottom of the other rocks, they are always found to rest on
granite; and secondly, no other rock has ever yet been
found beneath it. From this circumstance granite is conceived
to be the solid foundation of the Earth’s Crust, and
so is often called fundamental granite. Above the granite
the Aqueous Rocks have been slowly spread out layer by
layer during the long lapse of ages, now in this part of the
world, now in that, according as each in its turn was exposed
to the action of water. The Volcanic Rocks do not occur
in any fixed order of succession. They are distributed irregularly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
over almost every country of the globe, occurring
sometimes in the form of cone-shaped mountains, sometimes
in the form of stately pillars, and sometimes in the
form of massive solid walls, called Dykes, forced right
through the softer Aqueous Rocks, which were deposited
on the surface of the Earth before the eruption. As to the
Metamorphic Rocks, which are supposed to owe their peculiar
character to the contact of molten mineral matter,
wherever they occur, they are found in the immediate
neighborhood of some Igneous Rock.</p>

<p>The condition of the Earth beneath its thin external crust
has never been the subject of direct observation; for Geologists
have never yet been able to penetrate below the
granite rocks. Nevertheless, this subject has been often
discussed, and has offered a wide field for philosophical
speculation. Upon one point all are agreed, that within
the Crust of the Earth an intense heat very generally prevails;&mdash;a
heat so intense that it would be quite sufficient,
acting under ordinary circumstances, to reduce all known
rocks to a state of igneous fusion. Hence it was a common
opinion among the older Geologists that the condition of
our globe is that of a vast central nucleus composed of
molten mineral, and covered over with a comparatively thin
external shell of solid rock. The most eminent Geologists,
however, of the present day, hesitate to accept this opinion.
They observe: (1) That we have not yet learned what the
material is of which the interior of the Earth is composed;
therefore we cannot tell for certain what degree of heat is
sufficient to reduce that material to a liquid state. (2) It is
uncertain how far the immense pressure at great depths
may operate to keep matter in a solid state, even when
raised to a very high degree of temperature. (3) There
are certain astronomical and physical difficulties involved
in this theory, which have not yet been fully cleared up.
Modern Geologists, therefore, proceeding with more caution
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
than their predecessors, while they regard the opinion
as probable, refuse to set it down as conclusively demonstrated.
But, that a very high temperature prevails in the
interior of our globe, is a conclusion, they say, which is
established by abundant evidence, and which may be regarded
as morally certain.</p>

<p>It may be asked how the various strata of Aqueous Rocks,
which constitute the chief portion of the Earth’s Crust, have
been lifted up above the level of the sea; for, according to
our theory, they were all first deposited under water. This
is a question that must inevitably occur to the mind of every
reader, and Geologists are ready with an answer. They tell
us that from the earliest ages the Crust of the Earth has been
subject to disturbance and dislocation. At various times
and in various places it was upheaved, and what had been
before the bed of the ocean became dry land; again it sunk
below its former level, and what had been before dry land
became the bed of the ocean. Thus, in the former case a
new stratum which had been deposited at the bottom of the
sea, with all its varied remains of a bygone age, was converted
for a season into the surface of the Earth, and became
the theatre of animal and vegetable life: while in
the latter case, the old surface of the Earth with its countless
tribes of animals and plants,&mdash;its <i>fauna</i> and <i>flora</i> as they
are called,&mdash;was submerged beneath the waters, there to receive
in its turn the broken up fragments of a former world,
deposited in the form of mud, or sand, or pebbles, or
minute particles of lime. Nor is this all; it is but a single
link in the chain of Geological chronology. We are asked
to believe that, in many parts of the globe, this upward and
downward movement has been going on alternately for unnumbered
ages; so that the very same spot which was first
the bed of the ocean, was afterward dry land, then the bottom
of an estuary or inland lake, then perhaps once more
the floor of the sea, and then dry land again: and furthermore
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
we are assured that, while it remained in each one of
these various conditions, thousands and thousands of years
may have rolled away.</p>

<p>But from what source does that mighty power come
which can thus upheave the solid Earth, and banish the
ocean from its bed? We are told in reply that this giant
power dwells in the interior of the Earth itself, and is no
other than the subterranean heat of which we have already
spoken. This vast internal fire acts with unequal force
upon different parts of the shell or Crust of the Earth, uplifting
it in one place, and in another allowing it to subside.
Now it is violent and convulsive, bursting asunder the solid
rocks, and shaking the foundations of the hills: again it is
gentle and harmless, upheaving vast continents with a
scarcely perceptible undulation, not unlike the long, silent
swell of the ocean. So it has been from the beginning,
and so it is found to be even now, in this last age of the
Geological Calendar. For even within historic times mountains
have been suddenly upheaved from the level plain;
and many parts of the Earth’s Crust have been subject to a
slow, wave-like movement, rising here and subsiding there,
at the rate of perhaps a few feet in a century. Sometimes,
too, the fiery liquid itself has burst its barriers, and poured
its destructive streams of molten rock far down into the
peaceful, smiling valleys.</p>

<p>This theory of an internal disturbing force, which from
time to time produces elevations and depressions of the
Earth’s Crust, serves to explain another phenomenon, that
cannot fail to have struck even the least observant eye.
The Aqueous Rocks of mechanical formation are said to
have been composed of minute fragments, which were first
held suspended in water, and afterward fell to the bottom.
If this be true, it follows that these rocks, in the first period
of their existence, must have been arranged in beds parallel
to the horizon, or nearly so. But we now find them, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
everybody knows, in a great variety of positions: sometimes
they are parallel to the horizon, sometimes inclined to
it, sometimes at right angles to it; sometimes, too, they are
broken right across, sometimes curved and twisted after a
very fantastic fashion. Now, all these appearances are the
natural results of an upheaving force acting irregularly from
below on the solid shell of the Earth. When the subterranean
fire is brought to bear equally at the same time on a
broad extent of surface, then the overlying strata are bodily
lifted up, and preserve their horizontal position. But when
the whole force acts with local intensity on a very contracted
area, then, at that particular spot, the rocks above will be
tilted up, and their position entirely changed. Sometimes
they will be only bent and crushed together, sometimes dislocated
and turned over; sometimes, perhaps, a mountain
will be formed, and the rocks before parallel to the horizon,
will afterward remain parallel to the slopes of the mountain.</p>

<p>There is another process known by the name of Denudation,
which we cannot pass over in silence, for it occupies
a very important place in the Natural History of our globe.
Since time first began Denudation has been ever going on
at the surface of the Earth, and it has left its mark more or
less distinctly upon every group of rocks, from the lowest to
the highest. It includes all the various operations by which
the old existing rocks are broken up into fragments, or
ground into powder, or worn away by friction, or dissolved
by chemical action, and then transported from their former
site to become the elements of new strata. Hence the
name Denudation; since by these operations the former
surface of the Earth is carried away and a surface before
covered is <i>laid bare</i>. The amount of destruction effected
by this process in each successive age is always equal to the
bulk of Aqueous Rocks formed within the same time.
This will be at once understood when we remember that
the Aqueous Rocks are produced, for the most part, by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
deposition of sediment; and sediment is nothing else than
the fragments, more or less minute, of pre-existing rocks.
What is deposited on the bed of the ocean has been taken
from the surface of the land; and the new strata are built
up from the ruins of the old. When we see a great building
of stone towering aloft to the sky, we are certain that
somewhere else on the Earth a quarry has been opened,
and that the amount of excavation in the quarry is exactly
represented by the bulk of solid masonry in the building.
Just in the same way, the mass of Aqueous Rocks is at once
the monument and the measure of previous Denudation.</p>

<p>The process of Denudation is the work of many and various
natural causes. Heat and cold, rain, hail, and snow,
chemical affinities, the atmosphere itself, all have a share in
it; but the largest share belongs to the mechanical action
of moving water. Every little rill that flows down the
mountain side is charged with finely-powdered sediment
which it is ever wearing away from the surface of its own
bed. Every great stream, besides the immense quantities
of mud and sand which in times of flood it carries along
in its turbulent course, has its channel strewn over with
pebbles at which it never ceases to work, rounding off the
angles and polishing the surfaces; and these pebbles, what
are they but the fragments of old rocks and the elements of
new,&mdash;the rubble-stone of Nature’s edifice on its way from
the quarry to the building? Then there are those mighty
rivers, such as the Amazon, the Orinoco, the Mississippi,
the Nile, the Ganges, discharging into the sea day by day
their vast freight of mineral matter, millions of cubic feet in
bulk, and thousands upon thousands of tons in weight.
Often this ponderous volume of mud or sand is carried far
out to sea by the action of currents, but sometimes it is
deposited near the shore, forming what is called a Delta,
and exhibiting an admirable example of stratified rock in
the earliest stage of its existence. Lastly, we have to notice
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
the giant power of the great ocean itself, acting with untiring
energies on the coasts of continents and islands all over
the world, excavating and undermining cliffs, rolling huge
rocks hither and thither, and spreading out the divided
fragments in a new order at the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>To apprehend fully the magnitude of the effects which
may fairly be ascribed to this last-mentioned power, we must
remember that, according to Geological theory, almost
every portion of the Earth’s Crust has been more than once
lifted up above the surface of the ocean, and afterward
depressed below it. It is believed that this alternate rising
and sinking was effected very often, perhaps most commonly,
not by sudden convulsions, but rather by slow or
gradual movements. Now, during this process, as the land
was emerging from the waters or sinking beneath them,
new surfaces would be presented in each succeeding century
to the force of the ocean currents and the erosive action of
the breakers; and it is not difficult to conceive that the
accumulated ruins produced, in a long lapse of time, by
destructive agents so powerful, so untiring, so universal,
may have readily furnished the materials for a very large
proportion of the Aqueous Rocks now in existence.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have considered the Crust of the Earth as a
great structure slowly reared up by the hand of Nature; we
have spoken of the Rocks that compose it, of their origin
and history, of the order in which they are disposed, and of
the various agencies that have been at work to mould them
into their present form and feature. We have now to contemplate
this marvellous structure under a new aspect; for
we are told by Geologists that it is a vast sepulchre, within
which lie entombed the remains of life that has long since
passed away. Each series of strata is but a new range of
tombs; and each tomb has a story of its own. Here a gigantic
monster is disclosed to view, compared to which the
largest beast that now roams through the forest is puny in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
form and contemptible in strength: there, within a narrow
space, millions of minute animal frames are found closely
compacted together, each so small that its existence can
be detected only by the aid of a powerful microscope. In
one place whole skeletons are found almost entire, embedded
in the bosom of the solid rock; in another, we have
a boundless profusion of bones and shells; and again
in another, neither the skeleton itself appears, nor yet its
scattered bones, but simply the imprint of footsteps once
left upon the sandy beach, and still remaining engraved on
the stone into which the fine sand has been converted
chiefly by the agency of pressure. There is no scarcity of
relics in this wonderful charnel-house of Nature. For
half a century the work of plunder has been going on
without relaxation or remorse; the tombs have been yielding
up their dead; every city in the civilized world has
filled its museums, and the cabinets of private collectors
are overflowing: but the spoils that have hitherto been
carried away seem to bear a very small proportion to those
which yet remain behind.</p>

<p>These remains of animals and plants embedded in the
Crust of the Earth are called Fossils; and Geologists maintain
that the Fossils preserved in each group of strata
represent the animals and plants that flourished on the
surface of the Earth, or in the waters of the ocean, when
that group of strata was in process of formation. There
they lived, and there they died, and there they were buried,
in the sand, or the shingle, or the mud that came down
from the waters above. Their descendants, however, still
lived on, and new forms of life were called into being by
the voice of the Omnipotent Creator, making, as it were,
a connecting link between the new age of the world that
was coming in and the old one that was passing away.
But they, too, died and found a tomb beneath the waters;
for Nature, with unexhausted energies, was still
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
busy collecting materials from the old rocks, and building
up the new. And so that age passed away like the former,
and another came; and every age was represented by its
own group of strata; and each group of strata was, in its
turn, covered over with a new deposit; and the tombs
were all sealed up, with their countless legions of dead,
their massive monuments of stone, their strange hieroglyphic
inscriptions. At length came the last stage of the world’s
history, and man appeared upon the scene; and it is his
privilege to descend into this wonderful sepulchre, and to
wander about amidst the monuments, and to strive to read
the inscriptions. In our own days more especially, eager
and enthusiastic students are abroad over the whole face
of the globe, and are gathering together from every country
the Fossil Remains of extinct worlds. By the aid of
Natural History they seek to assign to each its own proper
place in the ranks of creation; to trace the rise, the progress,
and the extinction of every species in its turn; and
even to describe the nature and the character of all the
various forms of life that have dwelt upon the Earth from
the beginning.</p>

<p>Such is the theory of Geology as expounded at the present
day by its most able and popular advocates. We have
passed over a multitude of minor details that we might not
weary our readers, and we have kept aloof from disputed
points that we might not get entangled in a purely scientific
controversy. Our object has simply been to gather together
into a systematic form those more general conclusions
which, however startling they may seem to practical men
of the world, and even to many of those whose minds have
been accustomed to the pursuit of science in other departments,
are nevertheless regarded as certain by all who have
devoted their lives to the study of Geology. It now remains
to investigate the facts on which these conclusions are
based, and to consider the line of argument by which so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
many able and earnest men have been led to accept them.
In this vast field of inquiry we shall chiefly direct our
attention to those points that bear upon the Antiquity
of the Earth; and in attempting to bring home to our
readers the nature and the force of Geological reasoning,
we shall confine ourselves altogether to simple and familiar
illustrations.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">In</span> the physical sciences it is a common principle of
reasoning to account for the phenomena that come
before us in nature, by the operation of natural
causes which we know to exist. Nay, this principle seems
to be almost an instinct of our nature, which guides even
the least philosophical amidst us, in the common affairs of
life. When we stand amongst the ruins of an ancient
castle, we feel quite certain that we have before us, not
alone the monument of Time’s destroying power, but also
the monument of human skill and labor in days gone by.
We entertain no doubt that ages ago the sound of the mason’s
hammer was heard upon these walls, now crowned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
with ivy; that these moss-grown stones were once hewn fresh
in the quarry, and piled up one upon another by human
hands; and that the building itself was designed by human
skill, and intended for the purposes of human habitation
and defence. Or, if we see a footprint in the sand, we
conclude that a living foot has been there; and from the
character of the traces it has left, we judge what was the
species of animal to which it belonged, whether man, or
bird, or beast. It is true that God is Omnipotent. He
might, if it had so pleased Him, have built the old castle
at the creation of the world, and allowed it to crumble
slowly into ruins: or he might have built it yesterday, and
made a ruin begin to be where no castle had stood before;
and covered the stones with moss, and mantled the walls in
ivy. And as to the footprint in the sand, it were as easy
for Him to make the impress there, as to make the foot that
left the impress. All this is true: but yet if any one were
to argue in this style against us, he would fail to shake our
convictions; we should still unhesitatingly believe that human
hands once built the castle, and that a living foot once
trod the shore.</p>

<p>Now, this principle of reasoning is the foundation on
which the ablest modern Geologists claim to build their
science. The untiring hand of Nature is ever busy around
us: they ask us to come and look at her works, and to
judge of what she has done in past ages, by that which she
is now doing before our eyes. She is still, they say, building
up her strata all over the globe, of limestone, and sandstone,
and clay; she is still lifting up in one place the bed
of the ocean, and in another submerging the dry land; she
is still bursting open the Crust of the Earth by the action of
internal fire, disturbing and tilting up the horizontal strata;
she is still upheaving her mountains and scooping out
her valleys. All these operations are open to our inspection;
we may go forth and study them for ourselves; we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
may examine the works that are wrought, and we may discover,
too, the causes by which they are produced. And
if it should appear that a very close analogy exists between
these works that are now coming into existence, and the
long series of works that are piled up in the Crust of the
Earth, it is surely not unreasonable to refer the latter class
of phenomena to the action of the same natural causes
which we know to have produced the former.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that this argument is deserving of a
fair and candid consideration. Let us proceed, then, to
examine how far it is founded on fact, and how far it can
be justly applied to the various heads of Geological theory.
We will commence with the origin and history of Stratified
Rocks; for this constitutes, in a manner, the framework on
which the whole system of Geology is supported and held
together. It is alleged that the elements of which Stratified
Rocks are composed are but the broken fragments and
minute atoms of pre-existing rocks, carried off by the agents
of Denudation, and spread out over some distant area in
regular beds or layers; which, in progress of ages, were
slowly consolidated into rocks of various quality and texture.
With the view of testing this theory by the light of
the principle just explained, we purpose, in the first place,
to exhibit some examples of the many forms in which the
process of Denudation is going on at the present day all
over the world; and afterward, to show that out of the
materials thus obtained Stratified Rocks of every description&mdash;Mechanical,
Chemical, Organic&mdash;are being regularly
built up in sundry places; and that these correspond in
every essential feature with the Stratified Rocks in the Crust
of the Earth.</p>

<p>Among the chemical agents of Denudation, there is none
more widely diffused than Carbonic acid gas. It is everywhere
given out by dead animal and vegetable matter during
the process of putrefaction; it is plentifully evolved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
from springs in every country; and it is emitted in
enormous quantities from the earth in all volcanic districts,
as well those in which the volcanoes are now extinct as
those in which they are active. Now, it is well known from
observation, that carbonic acid has the property of decomposing
many of the hardest rocks, especially those in which
felspar is an ingredient. This phenomenon is exhibited on
a large scale in the ancient volcanic district of Auvergne, in
central France. The carbonic acid, which is abundantly
evolved from the earth, penetrates the crevices and pores
of the solid granite, which being unable to resist its decomposing
action, is rapidly crumbling to pieces. This
mysterious decay of hard rock has been happily called by
Dolomieu, “la maladie du granite.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>Again, all the water which flows over the surface of the
land is highly charged with carbonic acid. The rain imbibes
it in falling through the atmosphere; and the rivers
receive still further accessions from the earth as they pursue
their course to the sea. In this combination we discover
a powerful agent of Denudation; for limestone rock will
be dissolved by water which is impregnated with carbonic
acid. Thus all the rivers and streams in the world, when
they flow through a limestone channel, are constantly dissolving
the solid rock and bearing away the elements of
which it is composed. A single example will be sufficient
to show the magnitude of the results which are thus produced.
It has been calculated by Bischof, a celebrated
German chemist, that the carbonate of lime which is carried
each year to the sea by the waters of the Rhine, is sufficient
for the formation of 32,000,000,000 of oyster shells; or, to
view the matter in another light, it would be sufficient to
produce a stratum of limestone one foot thick, and four
square miles in extent.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> If such be the yearly produce of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
one river, how great must be the accumulated effects of all
the rivers in the world since our planet first came from the
hand of its Creator!</p>

<p>Passing from the chemical to the mechanical agents of
Denudation, it is worth while to notice the immense power
which is often generated by the agency of frost, especially
in those countries that are subject to great vicissitudes of
heat and cold. During a thaw, water finds its way into the
clefts and joints by which all rocks are traversed, and when
it is afterward converted into ice, it expands with a mechanical
force that is almost irresistible. The hardest rocks are
burst asunder, great blocks are detached from the mountain
side, and sent rolling down its slopes, or tumbling over
crags and precipices, until at length they come to rest in
shattered fragments at the bottom of the valley. In this
condition they await but the coming of the winter’s torrent
to be borne still further on their long journey to the sea.</p>

<p>The fearful havoc done in this way by the alternate action
of sun and frost contributes in no small degree to the fantastic
and picturesque forms assumed by the mountain peaks
of Switzerland. Huge masses of rock have been literally
hewn away, until nothing has remained behind but those
splintered obelisks and tapering pinnacles so familiar to the
eye amidst the sublime scenery of the Alps. Indeed one of
the greatest perils encountered by the adventurous spirits
whose ambition it is to rival one another in the danger of
their exploits, and to climb whatever was before regarded as
inaccessible, arises from the enormous fragments of rock
which are rent almost unceasingly from the overhanging
crags and hurled into the abysses below them. The following
incident related by Professor Tyndall is very much to
the point. “We had gathered up our things, and bent to
the work before us, when suddenly an explosion occurred
overhead. Looking aloft, in mid-air was seen a solid shot
from the Matterhorn describing its proper parabola through
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
the air. It split to pieces as it hit one of the rock-towers
below, and its fragments came down in a kind of spray,
which fell wide of us, but still near enough to compel a
sharp look out. Two or three such explosions occurred
afterward, but we crept along the back fin of the mountain,
from which the falling boulders were speedily deflected
right and left.”</p>

<p>This occurred in 1862, on the occasion of an unsuccessful
attempt to reach the highest peak of the Matterhorn.
Six years later, when Professor Tyndall at length actually
accomplished the object on which he seems to have set his
heart, he found the work of destruction still going on.
“We were now,” he says in his narrative, “beside a snow-gully,
which was cut by a deep furrow along its centre, and
otherwise scarred by the descent of stones. Here each
man arranged his bundle and himself so as to cross the
gully in the minimum of time. The passage was safely
made, a few flying shingle only coming down upon us.
But danger declared itself where it was not expected. Joseph
Maquignas led the way up the rocks. I was next,
Pierre Maquignas next, and last of all the porters. Suddenly
a yell issued from the leader: ‘Cachez vous!’ I
crouched instinctively against the rock, which formed a by
no means perfect shelter, when a boulder buzzed past me
through the air, smote the rocks below me, and with a savage
hum flew down to the lower glacier.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>Even in our own country, every one is familiar with the
efficacy of frozen water in producing landslips. The rain
which soaks into the ground in winter, is converted into ice
when frost sets in; and upon steep slopes or precipices, its
expansive power bursts open the earth, and causes large
masses of stones and clay to tumble headlong to the bottom.</p>

<p>But moving water constitutes the most powerful, and, at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
the same time, the most universal agent of Denudation.
And it is chiefly to the effects of moving water that we
mean to direct attention; because its action is more striking
to the eye, and more easily understood by the general
reader. Every one is aware that the waters of the ocean
are constantly passing off by evaporation into the higher
regions of the atmosphere, and are there condensed into
clouds. These clouds in course of time descend upon all
parts of the earth, but especially on the high and mountainous
districts. Then rivulets are formed which flow
smoothly down the gentle slopes of the undulating country,
or plunge headlong over the rocky mountain cliffs; and
the rivulets uniting form streams, and the streams, receiving
new tributaries as they advance, become rivers; and the
rivers flow on to the sea, and discharge each day and each
hour their enormous volumes of water back again into the
ocean from which they came. Thus all the water of the
world is constantly in motion, ever hurrying on, as it were,
in one unending round of duty. This is the teaching of
daily experience and observation. And we may add, it is
the teaching of Sacred Scripture as well. The Wise Man
said long ago: “All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea
doth not overflow: unto the place from whence the rivers
come, thither they return to flow again.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>Now, the power of this moving water is a mighty wide-spread
agent of change in the physical condition of the
globe. For wherever water is in motion over the surface
of the land, whether it be a rippling stream, or a mountain
torrent, or a majestic river, it is surely wearing away the
channel through which it flows, and carrying along in its
course particles of clay, or sand, or gravel. This subject
is illustrated with great force and great simplicity by Mr.
Page. “Every person,” he says, “must have observed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
the rivers in his own district, how they become muddy and
turbid during floods of rain, and how their swollen currents
eat away the banks, deepen the channels, and sweep away
the sand and gravel down to some lower level. And if,
during this turbid state, he will have the curiosity to lift a
gallon of the water, and allow it to settle, he will be astonished
at the amount of sediment or solid matter that falls
to the bottom. Now, let him multiply this gallon by the
number of gallons daily carried down by the river, and this
day by years and centuries, and he will arrive at some faint
idea of the quantity of matter worn from the land by rivers,
and deposited by them in the ocean. In the same way as
one river grinds and cuts for itself a channel, so does every
stream and rill and current of water. The rain as it falls
washes away what the winds and frosts have loosened; the
rill takes it up, and, mingling it with its own burden, gives
it to the stream; the stream takes it up and carries it to the
river, and the river bears it to the ocean.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>When the current is feeble, the greater part of this earthy
material is thrown down upon the way, and forms a stratum
of alluvial soil in the bed of the river, and also in the
adjoining lowlands, during the time of temporary floods.
But when several streams unite, then the carrying power
of the current is enormously increased: huge stones are
rolled along, and dashed one against another, and broken
into fragments, and the fragments are rounded by friction,
and become pebbles, and the pebbles become gravel, and
the gravel, mud; and the mud is carried on to the mouth
of the river, and there falling to the bottom, it forms a
tongue of land which is called a delta; or else perhaps it
chances to meet with some great ocean current, and then it
begins a new journey, and is borne far away to be deposited
in the profound and tranquil depths of the sea. It is not,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
however, mineral matter alone that is transported by the
action of rivers. Trees that once were growing on the
banks of the stream, and the bones of animals, and human
remains, and works of art, are seen floating down with the
current, and are found embedded in the sand and mud of
the delta at the river’s mouth.</p>

<p>These are some of the actual realities which all may witness,
who will go and study for themselves the history of
this wonderful element, from the time when it first soars aloft
as vapor to the sky, until it returns to the bosom of its
parent ocean laden with the spoils of the land. To some of
our readers, perhaps, results of this kind may appear insignificant,
when considered in relation to the enormous bulk
of the stratified rocks. But it should be remembered that
the force of which we speak is unceasing in its operation
over the whole surface of the earth; and even though the
work were small which is accomplished in each successive
year, the accumulated effects produced in a lengthened
period of time must be immensely great. Besides, it would
be a very serious error to form our ideas on this subject, as
many would seem to do, from the examples which are to
be found within the narrow limits of our own island. We
should rather seek for our illustrations among those mighty
rivers that drain the vast continents of the world, and exhibit
the erosive and transporting power of running water on the
grandest scale.</p>

<p>It happens, fortunately for our purpose, that an attempt
has been made by scientific men to compute the amount
of matter discharged into the sea, by some particular rivers
within a given time. For such a computation it is necessary,
in the first place, to calculate the volume of water that
passes down the channel during that time; and then, by
repeated experiments, to ascertain the average proportion
of earthy matter which is held suspended in the water.
This has been done with the greatest care by the Rev. Mr.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
Everest, in the case of the river Ganges; and it appears
that during the rainy season, which lasts four months every
year, from June to September, about 6,000,000,000 cubic
feet of mud are carried along by the stream past the town
of Ghazepoor, near which the observations were made.
Now this enormous bulk of mineral matter would be sufficient
to form a stratum of rock one foot in height, and two
hundred and eighteen square miles in extent. Or, to
adopt the computation of Sir Charles Lyell, the amount
which passes by every day is equal to that which might be
transported by 2000 Indiamen, each freighted with a cargo
of mud 1400 tons in weight. And it is important to
remember that this estimate represents but a portion of the
sediment which passes into the sea through the channel of
the Ganges; for the observations of Mr. Everest were taken
at a point which is 500 miles from the sea, and at which
the river has not yet received the contributions of its largest
tributaries.</p>

<p>We are able, therefore, with some degree of confidence,
to estimate the amount of Denudation which is every year
effected by the Ganges. And, although the same calculations
have not yet been applied with equal care to other
great rivers, there is no reason to suppose that the Ganges
is an exception. It is asserted on good grounds that the
Brahmapootra, which unites with the Ganges close to the
Bay of Bengal, carries with it an equal amount of earthy
sediment. According to Sir Charles Lyell, the quantity of
solid matter brought down each year by the Mississippi
amounts to 3,702,758,400 cubic feet. And it is said that
48,000,000 cubic feet of earth are <i>daily</i> discharged into the
sea by the Yellow River in China, called by the natives the
Hoang Ho.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> Thus year after year the waste of the land is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
carried away by rivers, to be spread out over wide areas of
the ocean, and perhaps to furnish the materials of future
continents.</p>

<p>The effects of running water in wearing away and transporting
masses of solid rock are not less deserving of our
notice. Every one who has followed the course of a great
river when it flows through a rocky channel, must have
observed large blocks projecting from the cliffs above,
which, having been undermined by the action of the water,
seem ready to tumble headlong into the stream; and others
lying below, which had fallen before; and others again
which had been already carried a considerable distance by
the winter’s torrent. Even where the rocks are not displaced,
they are gradually being worn away, partly by the
friction of the water, but much more by the grinding action
of the gravel which the water holds in suspension. Not
only is the surface of the rocks thus rounded and polished,
but large circular pits, called <i>pot-holes</i>, are formed by the
whirling waters of an eddy carrying round and round a few
grains of hard sand.</p>

<p>At the falls of the Clyde near Lanark in Scotland, these
various phenomena may be seen to great advantage. Good
illustrations are to be found also in many volcanic regions.
Some of the larger streams in Auvergne have in course of
time forced their way through the solid lava rock, cutting
out for themselves channels broad and deep. In Sicily too,
we are told, the river Simeto, whose course was blocked up
by a current of lava about the beginning of the seventeenth
century, has since that time eaten its way through this compact
and hardened mass, and now flows on to the sea
through a rocky passage forty feet in depth and from fifty to
several hundred feet in width.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>But there is no part of the world yet explored where these
effects are exhibited on the same gigantic scale as at the far-famed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
Falls of Niagara. The massive limestone rock from
which the waters are precipitated is slowly but certainly disappearing.
An enormous volume of water, more than a
third of a mile in breadth, plunges in a single bound over
a sheer precipice of one hundred and sixty-five feet. The
soft slaty rocks upon which the limestone rests are soon
eaten away by the action of the spray which rises from the
pool below; and then the overhanging cliffs, left without
any support, topple over, and are carried off by the torrent.
The position of the Falls, therefore, is not stationary, but
is receding by very sensible degrees in the direction of Lake
Erie, from which the river flows. Speaking of this phenomenon,
Sir Charles Lyell observes with much show of
reason: “The idea of perpetual and progressive waste is
constantly present to the mind of every beholder: and as
that part of the chasm which has been the work of the last
hundred and fifty years resembles precisely in depth, width,
and character the rest of the gorge, which extends seven
miles below, it is most natural to infer, that the entire
ravine has been hollowed out in the same manner, by the
recession of the cataract. It must at least be conceded,
that the river supplies an adequate cause for executing the
whole task thus assigned to it, provided we grant sufficient
time for its completion.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>With a view to enable our readers to understand more
fully the prodigious force which rivers have been known to
exert in the transportation of rocks, it may be useful to
draw attention to one or two principles of physical science.
First, we have the well-known law of Archimedes, that <i>a
solid body immersed in a liquid loses a part of its weight equal
to the weight of the liquid displaced</i>. Now solid rock as compared
with water, bulk for bulk, is rarely more than three
times, and often not more than twice as heavy. Consequently,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
according to this law, almost all rocks will lose a
third of their weight, and many will lose one-half, when
immersed in water. Again, it has been established that <i>the
power of water to move bodies that are in it increases as the
sixth power of the velocity of the current</i>. Hence, if the
velocity of a current is increased <i>two-fold</i>, its moving power
will be increased <i>sixty-four fold</i>; if the velocity is increased
<i>three-fold</i>, the moving power will be increased <i>seven hundred
and twenty fold</i>; and so on.</p>

<p>From these principles it follows, first, that a much smaller
power is required to move a block of stone lying in the bed
of a river, than if it were lying on the surface of the land;
and secondly, that a very slight increase in the velocity of a
current effects a very great increase in its moving power.
We need not wonder, then, when we hear of the enormous
masses of rocks and trees and mason-work which are carried
away even by small rivers in times of flood.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>Here are a few examples. In August, 1829, a fragment
of sandstone, fourteen feet long, three feet wide, and one
foot thick, was carried by the river Nairn, in Scotland, a
distance of two hundred yards. On the same occasion the
river Dee swept away a bridge of five arches, built of solid
granite, which had stood uninjured for twenty years; the
whole mass of masonry sunk into the bed of the stream
and was seen no more. And the river Don, as we are
assured on the authority of Mr. Farquharson, forced a mass
of stones four or five hundred tons in weight up a steep inclined
plane, leaving them in a great rectangular heap on
the summit. A small rivulet called the College, in Northumberland,
when swollen by a flood in August, 1827, “tore
away from the abutment of a mill-dam a large block of
greenstone-porphyry weighing nearly two tons, and transported
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
it to the distance of a quarter of a mile.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> But it is
needless to multiply examples of phenomena which are
occurring every day around us, and of which many among
our readers have probably been eye-witnesses.</p>

<p>The transporting power of rivers must not always be estimated
by the bulk and velocity of the current; for it is often
greatly increased by some accidental obstruction, which for
a time blocks up the channel through which the river flows.
An instructive illustration is afforded by the river Dranse,
which flows through the valley of Bagnes, in Switzerland,
and empties itself into the Rhone above the lake of Geneva.
In the year 1818 the avalanches which fell down from the
mountain side formed a barrier across the valley, and thus
effectually blocked up the course of the stream. The upper
part of the valley was, in consequence, soon converted into
a lake which gradually increased in size as the season advanced.
When summer came, and the melting of the
snows began, the ice barrier suddenly gave way with a tremendous
crash, and the lake was emptied in half an hour.
The mass of water, thus in a moment disengaged, burst
with destructive violence over the lower valley, sweeping
away rocks, forests, houses, bridges, and cultivated lands.
Thousands of trees were torn up by the roots, fragments of
granite as large as houses were rolled along, and the whole
flood presented the appearance of a moving mass of ruins.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">While</span> the rain, the rivers, and the streams, are
thus wasting away the mountains and plains of the
interior country, the waves of the sea are exerting
a power no less destructive on the coasts of islands and of
continents. The breakers dashing against the foot of a
lofty cliff, dissolve and decompose and wear away the lower
strata; and the overhanging rocks, thus undermined, fall
down in course of time by their own weight. With the
next returning wave these rocks are themselves hurled
back against the cliff; and so, as some one has happily
remarked, the land would seem to supply a powerful artillery
for its own destruction. The effects of the breakers
are often very unequal, even on the same line of cliffs.
Some parts of the rock are more yielding than others, or
perhaps they are more exposed to the action of the waves,
or perhaps they are divided by larger joints and more freely
admit the destructive element. These parts will be the first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
to give way, while the harder and less exposed rock will be
left standing: and in this way forms the most capricious
and fantastic are produced.</p>

<p>No finer examples could be wished for than those which
are seen in the neighborhood of Kilkee, and along the
promontory of Loop Head, in the county of Clare. Sometimes
the ground is undermined with caverns, into which,
when the tide is coming in, the waves of the Atlantic rush
with resistless force, making new additions each day to the
accumulated ruins of ages. Sometimes lofty pinnacles of
rock are left standing in the midst of the waters, like giant
sentinels stationed there by Nature to guard the coast. In
one or two instances these isolated fragments are connected
with the main land by natural arches of rock, which are
called <i>fairy bridges</i> by the people; but more commonly
they appear as rocky islets, and answer exactly to the poet’s
description&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>It is interesting to observe in passing, that, in the original
verses of the &AElig;neid, of which these lines are Dryden’s translation,
Virgil has recorded a belief which prevailed in his
time, and which, upon scientific grounds, is now regarded
as highly probable by Geologists, that the island of Sicily
had been once connected by land with Italy, and was separated
from it by the action of the waves:</p>

<p>But whatever may be thought of this opinion thus rendered
immortal by the genius of the poet, we shall not stop
to discuss its merits. For in the present stage of our argument,
it is our object to deal, not with vague and uncertain
traditions, nor even with philosophical speculations, but
rather with the facts which are actually going on in nature,
and which any one of our readers may examine for himself.
With this object in view, we shall take a few examples from
the Eastern and Southern coasts of Great Britain, which
have been carefully explored by scientific men for the purpose
of observing and recording the amount of destruction
accomplished by the waves within recent times.</p>

<p>The Shetland Islands, exposed to the whole fury of the
Atlantic, present many phenomena not unlike those of Kilkee
and Loop Head, but upon a far grander scale. Whole
islands have been swept away by the resistless power of the
waters, and of others nothing remains but massive pillars
of hard rock, which have been well described as rising up
“like the ruins of Palmyra in the desert of the ocean.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
Passing to the mainland, it is recorded that in the year
1795 a village in Kincardineshire was carried away in a
single night, and the sea advanced a hundred and fifty yards
inland, where it has ever since maintained its ground. In
England, almost the whole coast of Yorkshire is undergoing
constant dilapidation. On the south side of Flamborough
Head the cliffs are receding at an average rate of two yards
and a quarter in the year, for a distance of thirty-six miles
along the coast. This would amount to a mile since the
Norman Conquest, and to more than two miles since the
occupation of York by the Romans. It is not surprising,
therefore, to learn that many spots marked in the old maps
of the country as the sites of towns or villages, are now
sandbanks in the sea. Even places of historic name have
not been spared. The town of Ravenspur, from which, in
1332, Edward Baliol sailed for the invasion of Scotland,
and at which Henry the Fourth landed in 1399, to claim
the throne of England, has long since been swallowed up
by the devouring element.</p>

<p>On the coast of Norfolk it was calculated, at the beginning
of the present century, that the mean loss of the land
was something less than one yard in the year. The inn at
Sherringham was built on this calculation in 1805, and it
was expected to stand for seventy years. But unfortunately
the actual advance of the sea exceeded the calculation. Sir
Charles Lyell, who visited this spot in 1829, relates that during
the five preceding years seventeen yards of the cliff had
been swept away, and nothing but a small garden was then
left between the building and the sea. The same distinguished
writer tells us that in the harbor of this town there
was at that time water sufficient to float a frigate where forty-eight
years before had stood a cliff fifty feet in height with
houses built upon it. And remarking upon these facts, he
says, that “if once in half a century an equal amount of
change were produced suddenly by the momentary shock
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
of an earthquake, history would be filled with records of
such wonderful revolutions of the earth’s surface; but if
the conversion of high land into deep sea be gradual, it
excites only local attention.”</p>

<p>In the neighborhood of Dunwich, once the most considerable
seaport on the coast of Suffolk, the cliffs have been
wasting away from an early period of history. “Two
tracts of land which had been taxed in the time of King
Edward the Confessor, are mentioned in the Conqueror’s
survey, made but a few years afterward, as having been
devoured by the sea.” And the memory of other losses in
the town itself&mdash;including a monastery, several churches,
the town-hall, the jail, and many hundred houses&mdash;together
with the dates of their occurrence, is faithfully preserved in
authentic records. In 1740 the sea reached the churchyard
of Saint Nicholas and Saint Francis, so that the graves, the
coffins, and the skeletons, were exposed to view on the face
of the cliffs. Since that time the coffins, and the tombstones,
and the churchyard itself, have disappeared beneath
the waves. Nothing now remains of this once flourishing
and populous city but the name alone, which is still attached
to a little village of about twenty houses. The spot
on which the Church of Reculver stands, near the mouth
of the Thames, was a mile inland in the reign of Henry
the Eighth; in the year 1834 it was overhanging the sea;
and it would long ago have been demolished, but for an
artificial causeway of stones constructed with a view to
break the force of the waves. It is estimated that the land
on the northeast coast of Kent is receding at the rate of
about two feet in the year. The promontory of Beachy
Head in Sussex is also rapidly falling away. In the year
1813 an enormous mass of chalk, three hundred feet in
length and eighty in breadth, came down with a tremendous
crash; and slips of the same kind have often occurred, both
before and since.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></p>

<p>To these examples from Great Britain we may add one
or two from the German Ocean. Seven islands have completely
disappeared within a very narrow area since the time
of Pliny; for he counted twenty-three between Texel and
the mouth of the Eider, whereas now there are but sixteen.
The island of Heligoland, at the mouth of the Elbe, has
been for ages subject to great dilapidation. Within the
last five hundred years three-fourths of it have been carried
away; and since 1770 the fragment that remains has been
divided into two parts by a channel which is at present navigable
for large ships. A still more remarkable instance of
destruction effected by the waves of the sea occurred in the
island of Northstrand, on the coast of Schleswig. Previous
to the thirteenth century it was attached to the mainland,
forming a part of the continent of Europe, and was a
highly cultivated and populous district about ten miles
long, and from six to eight broad. In the year 1240 it was
cut off from the coast of Schleswig by an inroad of the sea,
and it gradually wasted away up to the seventeenth century,
when its entire circumference was sixteen geographical
miles. Even then the industrious inhabitants,&mdash;about nine
thousand in number,&mdash;endeavored to save what remained
of their territory by the erection of lofty dykes; but on the
eleventh of October, 1634, the whole island was overwhelmed
by another invasion of the sea, in which 6000 people
perished, and 50,000 head of cattle. Three small islets
are all that now remain of this once fertile district.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>The breakers of the ocean receive no small aid in their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
work of destruction from the action of tides and currents
which co-operate with the winds to keep the waters of the
sea in constant motion. And though the winds may sleep
for a time, the tides and currents are always actively at work,
and never for a moment cease to wear away the land. But
they are even more powerful auxiliaries as agents of transport.
If it were not for them, the ruins which fall from the
rocks to-day would to-morrow form a barrier against the
waves, and the work of destruction would cease. But Nature
has ordained it otherwise. When the tide advances, it
rolls the broken fragments toward the land, and when it
recedes, it carries them back to the deep; and so by unceasing
friction these fragments are worn away to pebbles, and
then, being more easily transported, they are carried off to
sea and deposited in the bed of the ocean: or else, perhaps,
they are cast up on the sloping shore, to form what is so
familiar to us all under the name of a shingle-beach.</p>

<p>This is a subject on which it is needless to enlarge.
Every one knows that the tides have the power of transporting
solid matter; though most of us, perhaps, do not fully
appreciate the magnitude of their accumulated effects, working
as they do with untiring energies upon the coasts of
islands and continents all over the world. It is not, however,
so generally known that the ocean is traversed in all
directions by powerful currents, which, from their regularity,
their permanence, and their extent, have been aptly called
the rivers of the ocean. We do not mean here to inquire
into the causes of these currents, upon which the progress
of physical science has thrown considerable light: neither
can we hope to describe even the principal currents that
prevail over the vast tracts of water which constitute about
three-fourths of the entire surface of our globe. We shall
content ourselves with tracing the course of one great
system, which may serve to give some idea of their general
character and enormous power.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<p>This system would seem to have its origin with a stream
that flows from the Indian Ocean toward the southwest,
and then doubling the Cape of Good Hope, turns northward
along the African coast. It is here called the South
Atlantic Current. When it encounters the shores of Guinea,
it is diverted to the west, and stretches across the Atlantic,
traversing forty degrees of longitude until it reaches the
projecting promontory of Brazil in South America. In this
part of its course it is known as the Equatorial Current,
because it follows pretty nearly the line of the Equator: it
varies in breadth from two hundred to five hundred miles,
and it travels at the mean rate of thirty miles a day, though
sometimes its velocity is increased to seventy or eighty.
Next, under the name of the Guyana Current, it pursues a
northwesterly direction, following the line of the coast;
and passing close to the island of Trinidad, becomes diffused,
and almost seems to be lost, in the Caribbean Sea.
Nevertheless, it again issues with renewed energy from the
Gulf of Mexico, and rushing through the Straits of Florida
at the rate of four and five miles an hour, it issues once
more into the broad waters of the Atlantic. From this out
it is called the Gulf Stream, and is well known to all who
are concerned in Transatlantic navigation; for it sensibly
accelerates the speed of vessels which are bound from
America to Europe, and sensibly retards those sailing from
Europe to America.</p>

<p>The Gulf Stream, however, does not set out on its Transatlantic
voyage directly that it issues from the Straits of Florida.
It keeps at first a northeasterly course, following the outline
of the American continent, passing by New York and Nova
Scotia, and brushing the southern extremity of the great
Newfoundland Bank. Then taking leave of the land, it
sweeps right across the Atlantic. After a time it seems to
divide into two branches, one inclining to the south, and
losing itself among the Azores, the other bending toward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
the north, washing the shores of Ireland, Scotland, Norway,
and reaching even to the frozen regions of Spitzbergen.
The breadth of the Gulf Stream, when it issues from the
Straits of Florida, is about fifty miles, but it afterward
increases to three hundred. Its color is a dark indigo blue,
which, contrasting sharply with the green waters of the
Atlantic, forms a line of junction distinctly visible for some
hundreds of miles: afterward, when this boundary line is
no longer sensible to the eye, it is easily ascertained by the
thermometer; for the temperature of the Gulf Stream is
everywhere from eight to ten degrees higher than that of
the surrounding ocean.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>We leave our readers to infer from this brief description
how immense must be the power of transport which belongs
to such currents as these. They sweep along the shores of
continents, and carry away the accumulated fragments of
rock, which had first been rent from the cliffs by the waves
of the sea, and then borne out to a little distance by the
tides: they pass by the mouths of great rivers, and receiving
the spoils of many a fertile and populous country, and
the ruins of many an inaccessible mountain ridge, they
hurry off to deposit this vast and varied freight in the deep
abysses of the ocean. There is one circumstance, however,
which we ought not to pass over in silence; for it is of
especial importance to the Geologist, and might easily
escape the notice of the general reader. It is a well ascertained
fact that plants and fruits and other objects from the
West Indian Islands are annually washed ashore by the
Gulf Stream on the northwestern coasts of Europe. The
mast of a man-of-war burnt at Jamaica was after some
months found stranded on one of the Western Islands of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
Scotland;<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> and General Sabine tells us that when he was
in Norway, in the year 1823, casks of palm-oil were picked
up on the shore near the North Cape, which belonged to a
vessel that had been wrecked the previous year at Cape
Lopez on the African coast.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> It seems most probable that
these casks of oil must first have crossed the Atlantic from
east to west in the Equatorial Current, then described the
circuit of the West Indian Islands, and finally coming in
with the Gulf Stream, recrossed the Atlantic, performing
altogether a journey of more than eight thousand miles.
From these facts it is clear that, by the agency of ocean
currents, the productions of one country may be carried to
another that is far distant. And Geologists do not fail to
make use of this important conclusion when they find the
animal and vegetable remains of different climates associated
together in the same strata of the Earth.</p>

<p>A Glacier is an enormous mass of solid ice filling up a
valley, and stretching from the eternal snows which crown
the summits of the mountains, down to the smiling cornfields
and rich pastures of the plains. It is constantly fed
by the accumulated snows of winter, which, slipping and
rolling down the slopes of the mountains, lodge in the valleys
below, and are there converted into ice. For it must
be remembered that the Glacier properly so called does not
commonly extend much higher than 9000 feet above the
level of the sea. Beyond that elevation the compact and
massive ice gradually passes into frozen snow, called by the
French Nev&eacute;, and by the Germans Firn. The change
which takes place in the condition of the snow as it descends
into the valley is chiefly owing to these two circumstances:
first, it is closely compacted together by the weight of the
snowy masses pressing down upon it from above; and secondly,
in the summer months it is thawed upon the surface
during the day by the heat of the sun, and frozen again at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
night. On a small scale this process is practically familiar
to every school-boy. When he makes a snow-ball he is
practically converting a mass of snow into ice, and that by
a series of operations very closely resembling those which
Nature employs in the manufacture of a Glacier.</p>

<p>In Switzerland the Glacier is often two or three miles in
breadth, from twenty to thirty miles in length, and five or
six hundred feet in depth. Though so vast in its bulk and
so solid in its character, it is not, as might be supposed, a
fixed, immovable mass. On the contrary, it is moving
incessantly, but slowly, down the valley which it occupies,
at the rate of several inches&mdash;sometimes one or two feet,
and even more&mdash;in the day. In Greenland a Glacier
explored by Doctor Hayes, in his expedition to the North
Pole, was found to move for a whole year at the average
rate of a hundred feet a day. It may be thought, perhaps,
that this fact requires further confirmation; but at all events
it is certain that the language of the poet, when he addresses
the Glaciers as “motionless torrents,” though it
conveys an accurate and beautiful idea of the appearance
they present to the eye, is not rigorously true in a scientific
sense. Indeed, it is just because the Glaciers are not motionless
that they serve as instruments of Denudation.</p>

<p>Their agency in this respect “consists partly in their
power of transporting gravel, sand, and huge stones, to
great distances, and partly in the smoothing, polishing, and
scoring of their rocky channels, and the boundary walls
of the valleys through which they pass. At the foot of
every steep cliff or precipice in high Alpine regions, a
sloping heap is seen of rocky fragments detached by the
alternate action of frost and thaw. If these loose masses,
instead of accumulating on a stationary base, happen to
fall upon a Glacier, they will move along with it, and, in
place of a single heap, they will form in the course of years
a long stream of blocks. If a Glacier be twenty miles long,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
and its annual progression about five hundred feet, it will
require about two centuries for a block thus lodged upon its
surface to travel down from the higher to the lower regions,
or to the extremity of the icy mass. This terminal point
usually remains unchanged from year to year, although
every part of the ice is in motion, because the liquefaction
by heat is just sufficient to balance the onward movement
of the Glacier, which may be compared to an endless file
of soldiers, pouring into a breach, and shot down as fast as
they advance.</p>

<p>“The stones carried along on the ice are called in Switzerland
the <i>moraines</i> of the Glacier. There is always one
line of blocks on each side or edge of the icy stream, and
often several in the middle, where they are arranged in
long ridges or mounds of snow and ice, often several yards
high. The reason of their projecting above the general
level, is the non-liquefaction of the ice in those parts of
the surface of the Glacier which are protected from the rays
of the sun, or the action of the wind, by the covering of the
earth, sand, and stones. The cause of <i>medial moraines</i> was
first explained by Agassiz, who referred them to the confluence
of tributary Glaciers. Upon the union of two
streams of ice, the right lateral moraine of one of the
streams comes in contact with the left lateral moraine of the
other, and they afterward move on together, in the centre,
if the confluent Glaciers are equal in size, or nearer to one
side if unequal.</p>

<p>“Fragments of stone and sand which fall through crevasses
in the ice, and get interposed between the moving
Glacier and the fundamental rock, are pushed along so as
to have their angles more or less worn off, and many of
them are entirely ground down into mud. Some blocks
are pushed along between the ice and the steep boundary
rocks of the valley, and these, like the rocky channel at the
bottom of the valley, often become smoothed and polished,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
and scored with parallel furrows, or with lines and scratches
produced by hard minerals, such as crystals of quartz, which
act like the diamond upon glass. The effect is perfectly
different from that caused by the action of water, or a
muddy torrent forcing along heavy stones; for these not
being held like fragments of rock in ice, and not being
pushed along under great pressure, cannot scoop out long
rectilinear furrows or grooves parallel to each other. The
discovery of such markings at various heights far above the
surface of existing Glaciers, and for miles beyond their
present terminations, affords geological evidence of the
former extension of the ice beyond its present limits in
Switzerland and other countries.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<img src="images/fig_2.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 2.&mdash;Iceberg seen in mid-ocean 1400 miles from any known land.</p>
</div>

<p>Sometimes, however, it happens, especially in extreme
northern and southern latitudes, that the glacier valley leads
down to the sea. In such cases, huge masses of ice are
floated off, and, with their ponderous burden of gravel,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
mud, and rocks, are carried away by currents toward the
equator. Immense numbers of these floating islands of
ice, or Icebergs, as they are called, are seen by mariners
drifting along in the Northern and Southern oceans. In
1822 Scoresby counted five hundred between the latitudes
69&deg; and 70&deg; N., many of which measured a mile in circumference,
and rose two hundred feet above the surface of the
sea.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> The annexed drawing, copied by kind permission
of the author from Sir Charles Lyell’s Principles of Geology,
affords a good idea of the appearance that such Icebergs
present to the eye. The one represented in the fore-ground
was supposed to reach a height of nearly three hundred
feet, and was observed with many others floating about
in the Southern Ocean at a distance of 1400 miles from any
known land. An angular mass of rock was visible on the
surface. The part exposed was twelve feet high and from
five to six broad: but it was conjectured, from the color of
the surrounding ice, that the greater part of the stone was
concealed from view.</p>

<p>How enormous must be the magnitude of those ponderous
masses may be learned from the fact that the bulk of
ice below the level of the water is about eight times as great
as that above: and in point of fact, Captain Sir John Ross
saw several of them aground in Baffin’s Bay, where the water
was 1500 feet deep. It has been calculated that the beds
of earth and stones which they carry along cannot be less
than from 50,000 to 100,000 tons in weight. Sir Charles
Lyell, writing in 1865 from the results of the latest investigations
on this subject, says: “Many had supposed that
the magnitude commonly attributed to icebergs by unscientific
navigators was exaggerated; but now it appears that
the popular estimate of their dimensions has rather fallen
within than beyond the truth. Many of them, carefully
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
measured by the officers of the French exploring expedition
of the Astrolabe, were between 100 and 225 feet high
above water, and from two to five miles in length. Captain
d’Urville ascertained one of them, which he saw floating, to
be <i>thirteen miles long</i>, and a hundred feet high, with walls
perfectly vertical.”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>They have been known to drift from Baffin’s Bay to the
Azores, and from the South Pole to the Cape of Good
Hope.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> As they approach the milder climate of the temperate
zones, the ice gradually melts away, and thus the
moraines of arctic and antarctic glaciers are deposited at the
bottom of the deep sea. In this way, submarine mountains
and valleys and table-lands are strewn over with scattered
blocks of foreign rocks, and gravel, and mud, which have
been transported hundreds of miles across the unfathomable
abysses of the ocean.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Though we are chiefly concerned with Glaciers and Icebergs
as agents of Denudation, yet we cannot pass away
from the subject without referring to the Geological theory
of an ancient Glacial Period. This little digression from
the main purport of our present argument will not be
unacceptable, we hope, to our readers. The theory is in
itself interesting and ingenious; and it offers an admirable
illustration of the kind of reasoning by which Geologists
are guided in their speculations.</p>

<p>It is well known that the action of moving ice leaves a
very peculiar and characteristic impress on the surface of
the rocks, and even on the general aspect of the country
over which it passes. This is no mystery of science, but
a plain fact which any one that chooses may observe for
himself. Every Glacier carries along in its course a vast
quantity of loose gravel, hard sand, and large angular
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
stones. A considerable proportion of these materials in
course of time fall through crevasses in the ice, and become
firmly embedded in the under surface of the Glacier. Then,
as the moving mass slowly descends the valley, they are
shoved along under enormous pressure, and the surface of
the rocks beneath is furrowed, scratched, and polished, in
a remarkable and unmistakable manner. The furrows and
scratches are rectilinear and parallel to an extent never seen
in the marks produced by any other natural agency: and
they always coincide more or less in their direction with the
general course of the valley. A reciprocal action often takes
place: the large blocks of stone, frozen into the under
surface of the Glacier, are themselves scored and polished
by friction against the floor and sides of the valley.</p>

<div id="fig_3" class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><i>aa</i>, White streaks or scratches. <i>bb</i>, Furrows.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>
</div>

<p>Similar effects are produced by Icebergs; not of course
when drifting about in the deep sea, but when they come
into contact with a gently-shelving coast and grate along the
bottom. These mountains of ice, laden with the d&eacute;bris of
the land, are often carried along with the velocity of from
two to three miles an hour; and before their enormous
momentum can be entirely destroyed, an extensive surface
of rock must have been rounded, grooved, and scarred,
pretty much in the same way as by the action of a Glacier.
There can be no failure of the grinding materials. During
the process of melting, the Iceberg is constantly turning
over according as the centre of gravity shifts its position;
and thus a new part of its surface, with fresh angular blocks
of stone, together with fresh masses of sand and gravel, is
constantly brought into contact with the floor of the ocean.
And this is not mere theory. All these phenomena may
be witnessed any day on the shores of Baffin’s Bay and
Hudson’s Bay, and along the coast of Labrador.</p>

<p>Again, the evidence of glacial action may be discovered
in the materials themselves which have been transported by
ice. Many of the large erratic blocks, after having travelled
immense distances, exhibit the same sharp angular appearance
as if they had only just fallen down from the cliff
on the mountain side. By this circumstance they are at
once distinguished from blocks of stone transported by
running water; for in these the angles are sure to be
rounded off by friction. Sometimes, too, they are deposited
not only far away from the same rock, but in regions where
no rock of the same kind exists. In the case of Icebergs,
they are not unfrequently carried many hundreds of miles
before being dropped into the depths of the ocean, and,
in the course of their long journey, borne over the lofty
ridges of submarine mountain chains.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it often happens that a Glacier shrinks
backward up the valley, and sometimes even disappears
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
altogether. When the melting of the ice at the lower
extremity exactly balances its onward progress, then the
Glacier seems stationary to the eye, and occupies from year
to year the same position. But, when a number of hot
seasons follow one another in immediate succession, the
ice is melted more rapidly than the Glacier advances, and
in consequence it gradually becomes shorter, and seems to
the eye to recede toward the upper parts of the valley. In
this case the long lines of moraines, which before had rested
on the ice, are left spread out on the plains or deposited
on the slopes of the mountain. Immense blocks of stone
are by this means frequently set down on the summits of
lofty crags, and in such like positions to which they could
not be brought by any other natural agency. These
Perched Blocks, as they are called, and also those long
regular mounds of earth and stones abound in several of
the Swiss valleys, and constitute a very striking feature of
Alpine scenery.</p>

<p>Now, it appears that all these various characteristic marks
of glacial operations can be distinctly traced in many
countries where the action of moving ice has been unknown
within the period of history. And on this fact is founded
the Geological theory of an ancient Glacial Period. We
are confidently assured that a great part of Northern Europe,
including even our own islands, not to speak of America
and other countries as well in the northern as in the
southern hemisphere, were, in some far distant age, the
scene of those same phenomena which are witnessed at the
present day amid the solemn grandeur of the Alps, and in the
frozen wastes of the Arctic regions. In that age enormous
Glaciers moved slowly downward from the snow-clad heights
over innumerable valleys now rich with the fruits of the earth;
ponderous Icebergs floated over wide areas of the ocean,
where now the dry land appears; and vast piles of promiscuous
rubbish, with great angular blocks of stone, were deposited
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
on the slopes and crests of submarine mountains that
now tower hundreds of feet above the level of the sea.</p>

<p>To illustrate this theory, we would begin with a country
where the vestiges of glacial operations in past times may
be studied side by side with the glacial phenomena of the
present day. In Switzerland it needs but little skill to discern
many marks and tokens of moving ice where moving
ice is no longer found. In descending, for example, the
valley of the Hasli or the valley of the Rhone, the intelligent
traveller can hardly fail to observe how the rocks all
around are scarred and furrowed, precisely after the same
fashion as the rocks in the higher parts of the same valleys
are now being scarred and furrowed by the Glacier of the
Aar and the Glacier of the Rhone. At intervals, too, may
be seen long mounds of unstratified gravel and mud, with
large fragments of rock, in every way resembling the terminal
moraines now daily accumulating at the extremities
of existing Glaciers. When these facts are once distinctly
brought home to the mind, it is impossible to resist the conclusion
that several of the Alpine Glaciers once extended far
beyond their present limits down the valleys of Switzerland.</p>

<p>If we proceed a little distance to the mountains of the
Jura, now wholly devoid of Glaciers, we shall find that the
same glacial phenomena with which we have become so
familiar in the Alps, are still everywhere presented to the
eye. And we feel instinctively impelled to pursue the same
line of inductive reasoning. Moving ice, we know from
abundant observation, is capable of producing these effects:
nor have we ever seen effects of this kind produced by any
other cause: nay, there is no other natural agent known
that is capable of producing such effects: it is therefore
reasonable to infer that moving ice was the cause of these
effects; and that, in some bygone age, great masses of ice
moved slowly over the valleys of the Jura as they now move
slowly over the valleys of the Alps.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<p>Another circumstance may here be noticed which is well
worthy of consideration. The Alps are composed of granite,
gneiss, and such like crystalline rocks: the Jura, of
limestone and various other formations, altogether different
from those of the Alps. Now, scattered loosely over the
valleys of the Jura, and perched upon its lofty crests, we
find immense angular blocks&mdash;some of them as large as
cottages&mdash;of the Alpine rocks. The question naturally
arises, how have they been transported to their present site.
Certainly not by the action of water; for in that case the
projecting angles would have been rounded off, and the
sharp edges worn away. But the work might have been
easily accomplished by the power of moving ice, and could
not have been accomplished by any other natural agency
with which we are acquainted. Thus we are led to conclude
that the Glaciers of the Alps must, by some means
or another, have once made their way northward across the
great valley of Switzerland, fifty miles wide, and deposited
their ponderous burdens of gravel, sand, and erratic blocks
on the mountains of the Jura.</p>

<p>It would carry us too far from our present purpose to
draw out this theory in all its details. But we cannot for-bear
briefly to touch upon some of the bold and startling
conclusions to which it has led. The Geologist having,
by patient and varied exercise, in the regions of existing
Glaciers, trained his eye and his judgment in the observation
of those phenomena that mark the action of moving
ice, soon begins to discover that they are not wanting in
other countries. They are not to be found, indeed, beneath
the burning sun of Africa, nor on the borders of the
Mediterranean Sea. But as he travels northward they begin
by degrees to appear; and when at length he reaches the
shores of the Baltic, they are spread out profusely before
him as they were in the bosom of the Alps. All this had
puzzled Geologists for years; but the clue has been found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
at last. What is going on to-day in Switzerland, and in
Greenland, and on the shores of Labrador, must have been
going on, ages ago, in Germany, and in Denmark, and on
the shores of the Baltic. We may argue from the effect to
the cause. Here are the moraines, the erratics, the perched
blocks, and the surfaces of rock furrowed and scratched
with ice: at some past time there must have been the moving
Glaciers and the floating Icebergs.</p>

<p>Following out this line of argument, and applying it to
countries nearer home, Geologists have come to the conclusion
that the Grampian Hills in Scotland, the mountains
of Kerry in Ireland, the Snowdonian heights in Wales, and
many other ranges of hills in these islands, were in former
times subjected to the action of moving ice. Nay, it is
contended, with much show of reason, that these islands
must have been, for a considerable time, in great part
submerged beneath the sea, and traversed by floating Icebergs.
When large erratic blocks are found in the immediate
neighborhood of the formation from which they have
been derived, then it is easy to explain their origin and to
trace their course. But it often happens that the nearest
rock of the same mineral composition, and therefore, the
nearest rock from which they can possibly have been derived,
is separated from the site which they now occupy by
a lofty chain of mountains. By what means, then, have
they been transported hither? Not by moving water, for
their sharp edges and projecting angles are still preserved.
Not by Glaciers; for a Glacier cannot climb a steep mountain
ridge. It would seem, indeed, that in the present
geographical distribution of land and water, there is no
natural cause which could carry them from the parent rocks
to their present position. But if we suppose that in some
long past age of the world, Great Britain and Ireland were
submerged beneath the sea, and that Icebergs floated in
the waters above, the problem is solved at once. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
fragments of far distant rocks frozen into the Icebergs might
then have been carried over the summits of what are now
lofty mountains, and as the ice melted away, might have
been deposited all along their slopes and even on their
highest crests.</p>

<p>The presence of marine shells, belonging chiefly to
species which now exist only in the arctic seas, affords a
strong confirmation of this hypothesis. For they are found
intimately associated with the erratic blocks, not merely in
valleys, to which the sea might be supposed to have had
access in times of extraordinary flood, but upon lofty mountains
at a height of five hundred, six hundred, and even
thirteen hundred feet above the level of the sea. There is
no difficulty in accounting for this phenomenon if we suppose
the country to have been at one time submerged, and
the glacial drift in which the shells are found embedded to
have been deposited by Icebergs on the floor of the ocean.
If we refuse to make this supposition the difficulty is simply
insurmountable.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But it is somewhat beside our purpose to wander so far
into the region of theory and speculation. Our main object
in these chapters has been to establish the fact that Denudation
is actually taking place to an almost incredible extent,
in the present age of the world. For this purpose we have
enumerated the principal agents by which this process is
carried on; and we have endeavored to show from the
authenticated researches of travellers and scientific men
that they have been at work within the period of history,
and are still at work around us. Our summary is, indeed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
brief; but it is still sufficient to demonstrate that, even during
the present age, the whole surface of the Globe has
been ever in a constant state of change; that mountain
heights have been worn away, and valleys have been scooped
out, and lofty cliffs have disappeared, and bold headlands
have been rent in twain, and rocks and earths have day by
day been broken up and dissolved and decomposed, by
the never ceasing operation of natural causes; and that
the broken fragments are at every moment moving along
over the surface of the land or through the depths of the
sea.</p>

<p>Now Geologists tell us that these are the raw materials of
a new building which is going on in these latter times under
the guiding hand of Nature. Indeed, they say it is not so
much a new building as the uppermost story of an old
building. If we descend into the Crust of the Earth we
may trace this building even from the foundations, which
are laid upon the solid granite, up through each successive
stage of limestone, and sandstone, slate, conglomerate, and
clay, until we come to the surface, where new strata, composed
of the same elements, and exhibiting the same general
characteristics, are slowly growing up before our eyes.
Thus will the idea gradually steal upon the mind, that the
works of ages long gone by are reproduced once again in
our own days, and that we may study the history of the
past in the mirror of the present which nature holds up to
our view.</p>

<p>This is the branch of Geological argument upon which
we are now about to enter. We have visited Nature,
as it were, in her quarry, and we have seen how she collects
her materials, how she fashions them to her purpose,
how she transports them to the place for which
they are designed. If it be true, as alleged, that with
these materials she is actually engaged, at the present moment,
in building upon the existing surface of our Globe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
a new series of stratified rocks, which are the exact
counterpart of those beneath, this fact affords at least a
very strong presumption in favor of one very important
principle in the theory of Geologists. Let us, then,

<p>The Stratification of Rocks is one of the most
remarkable features which the Crust of the Earth
presents to our notice; and the principles by
which this phenomenon is explained belong to the very
foundation of Geological theory. It is now universally
agreed that the successive layers or strata, which constitute
such a very large proportion of the Earth’s Crust, and
which cannot fail to attract the notice even of the most
careless observer, have been slowly built up during a long
series of ages by the action of natural causes. In support
of this bold and comprehensive theory, geologists appeal to
the operations which are going on in nature at the present
day, or which have been observed and recorded within historic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
times. There is a vast machinery, they say, even now
at work all over the world, breaking up the rocks that appear
at the surface of the Earth, transporting the materials
to different sites, and there constructing new strata, just the
counterpart of those which we see piled up one above the
other, wherever a section of the Earth’s Crust is exposed to
view. It is given to us, therefore, on the one hand to contemplate
the finished work as it exists in the Crust of the
Earth, and on the other, to examine the work still in progress
upon its surface; and if both are found to agree in all
their most remarkable characteristics, it is not unreasonable
to infer that the one was produced in bygone ages by the
very same causes that are now busy in the production of
the other.</p>

<p>In the examination of this argument we first turned our
attention to the numerous and powerful agents that are now
employed in the breaking up and transporting of existing
rocks. It was impossible within our narrow limits to enumerate
them all. But we selected those which are at the same
time the most familiar in their operations, and the most
striking in their results:&mdash;mighty rivers discharging daily
and hourly into the sea the accumulated spoils of vast continents;
the breakers of the ocean dashing with unceasing
energy against all the cliffs and coasts of the world; the
tides and currents of the sea taking up the ruins which the
breakers have made, and carrying them far away to the
lonely depths of the ocean; the frozen rain bursting massive
rocks asunder with its expansive force, and sending
the fragments over lofty cliffs and steep precipices to become
the prey of roaring mountain torrents, or perhaps,
more fortunate, to find a place of tranquil rest on the bosom
of the glittering Glacier; then this wondrous Glacier itself,
a moving sea of ice, bearing along its ponderous burden
from the summits of lofty mountains far down into the
smiling plains, and meanwhile, with tremendous power,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
grinding, and furrowing, and wearing away the floor of the
valley, and leaving behind it an impress which even time
cannot efface; and lastly, the massive Icebergs which stud
the northern and southern seas, drifting along like floating
islands above the fathomless abysses of the ocean, and scattering
their huge boulders over the surface of submarine
mountains and valleys.</p>

<p>All these phenomena have been learned from actual and
repeated observation. They are not philosophical speculations,
but ascertained facts. We cannot doubt, therefore,
that the work of demolition is going on; it remains for us
now to inquire about the work of reconstruction.</p>

<p>The reader will remember that Geologists divide the
stratified rocks into three distinct classes, Mechanical,
Chemical, and Organic. This distinction, they say, is
founded on the actual operations of Nature. From a
close examination of the natural agents now at work in
the world, it appears that some strata are being formed
chiefly by the action of mechanical force; others chiefly
by the influence of chemical laws; and others again chiefly
by the intervention of organic life. Thus we have three
distinct classes of rock at present coming into existence,
each exhibiting its own peculiar characteristics, and each,
moreover, having its counterpart among the strata that
compose the Crust of the Earth. We shall now proceed
to set forth some of the evidence that may be advanced
in favor of these important conclusions, beginning with
those rocks that are called Mechanical.</p>

<p>And first it is important to have, at least, a general idea
of the appearance which Mechanical Rocks present to the
eye. We shall take three familiar examples, Conglomerate,
Sandstone, and Clay. Conglomerate, or Pudding-stone as
it is sometimes called, is composed of pebbles, gravel, and
sand, more or less compacted together, and generally forming
a hard and solid mass. The various materials of which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
it is composed, though united in the one rock, nevertheless
remain their own external forms, and may be distinctly recognized
even by the unpractised eye. Sandstone, as the
name implies, is made up of grains of sand closely compressed
and cemented together. The quality and appearance
of this rock vary very much according to the size and
character of its constituent particles. Often the grains of
sand are as large as peas, or even larger; sometimes they
are so minute that they cannot be distinguished without the
aid of a lens. For the most part they consist of quartz,
with grains of limestone intermixed; and they are usually
rounded, as if by the action of running water. Clay is a
rather vague and general term, now commonly employed
to denote any finely-divided mineral matter which contains
from ten to thirty per cent. of Alumina, and is thereby rendered
plastic, and capable, when softened with water, of
being moulded like paste with the hand. It occurs in
many different forms among the strata of the Earth, according
to the different minerals that enter into its composition
and the different influences to which it has been
subjected. Marl and Loam may be taken as well-known
illustrations: the former is a clay in which there is a large
proportion of calcareous matter; the latter is a mixture of
clay and sand. Sometimes by pressure clay is condensed
into a kind of slaty rock called Shale, which has the property
of being easily split up into an immense number of
thin plates or lamin&aelig;.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that there is not always a perfect
uniformity in the structure of these rocks. In Conglomerate,
for example, the pebbles may be as large as
cannon balls, or they may be only the size of walnuts.
So, too, we have every variety of fineness and coarseness
in the quality of Sandstone. Again, both Conglomerate
and Sandstone are often largely adulterated with clay, and
on the other hand, clay will sometimes contain more than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
its usual proportion of sand or lime. Lastly, these materials
are in one place compacted into hard and solid rock, in
another they are found in a loose and incoherent condition.</p>

<p>But amidst all these varieties of form and texture, the
rocks we have been describing generally preserve their peculiar
characteristics, and with a little experience can be
easily recognized. They are found to constitute a very
large part, perhaps we might say the larger part, of the
stratified rocks in every country that has hitherto been explored
by Geologists. Wherever we go we are met by
the same familiar appearances;&mdash;beds of Conglomerate,
Sandstone, Clay, Marl, Shale, recurring again and again
through a series of many hundred strata, sometimes in one
order, and sometimes in another; sometimes without any
formation of a different kind intervening, and sometimes
alternating with limestone or other rocks of which we shall
speak hereafter.</p>

<p>Such is the general character and appearance of those
strata which are known among Geologists as Aqueous
Rocks of Mechanical origin. Now, it must at once strike
the reader, that these rocks are made up of just those very
materials&mdash;the same both in kind and in form&mdash;that we have
already shown to be daily prepared and fashioned by a vast
and complex machinery in the great workshop of Nature.
He will remember how enormous blocks are detached
from the mountain side, or from the cliffs on the seashore,
and broken up into fragments; how the fragments in time
become pebbles, sand, and mud; and how these are caught
up by rivers, tides, and currents, and carried far away to sea.
Here we have certainly all the materials that are necessary
for the building up of Conglomerate, Sandstone, and Shale.
We have seen how they are prepared by the hand of Nature,
how they are moulded into shape, how they are transported
from place to place. Let us now pursue the sequel
of their history, and follow them on to the end.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span></p>

<p>It is plain they cannot remain forever suspended in
water; sooner or later they must fall to the bottom. Yet
they will not all fall together. For though all are carried
downward by the one force of gravity, those materials that
are smaller and lighter will be more impeded by the resistance
of the water. The pebbles and coarse gravel will
be the first to reach the bottom, then the sand, and last
of all the fine, impalpable mud. Thus, as the current
sweeps along in its course, the sediment which it bears
away from the land will be in a manner sorted, and three
distinct layers of different materials will be deposited in
the bed of the ocean;&mdash;first, nearest to the shore, a layer
of pebbles and coarse gravel, then a layer of sand, and last
of all a layer of fine mud or clay. This is the first step in
the construction of stratified rock. To complete the work
nothing more is necessary than the consolidation of these
loose and incoherent materials. If this could be accomplished,
then we should have a solid stratum of Conglomerate,
a solid stratum of Sandstone, and a solid stratum of
Shale formed in the bed of the ocean.</p>

<p>With regard to this operation, however, we cannot hope
for the advantage we have hitherto enjoyed, of actual observation.
The process of consolidation, if it take place at
all, is going on in the depths of the Sea. But though it is
thus removed beyond the reach of our senses, it is not
beyond the reach of our intelligence. We may borrow the
torch of Science, and search even into the hidden recesses
of Nature’s secret laboratory.</p>

<p>In the first place, a partial consolidation of clay and
sand, and even of gravel, may take place under the influence
of pressure alone. Many of us are familiar with this
truth, but few, perhaps, are aware how extensively it is illustrated
in the practical arts of life. Here are some curious
and interesting examples. The minute fragments of coal
which are produced by the friction of larger blocks against
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
one another, and which may be obtained abundantly in the
neighborhood of every coal mine, are now manufactured
into a solid patent fuel by the simple process of forcible compression.
Again, the dust and rubble of black lead, formerly
cast aside as useless, are now carefully collected, and
by no other force than pressure are converted into a solid
mass, fit to be employed in the manufacture of lead-pencils.
“The graphite or black lead of commerce,” says Sir
Charles Lyell, “having become very scarce, Mr. Brockedon
contrived a method by which the dust of the purer
portions of the mineral found in Borrowdale might be recomposed
into a mass as dense and as compact as native
graphite. The powder of graphite is first carefully prepared
and freed from air, and placed under a powerful
press on a strong steel die, with air-tight fittings. It is then
struck several blows, each of a power of a thousand tons;
after which operation the powder is so perfectly solidified that
it can be cut for pencils, and exhibits, when broken, the
same texture as native graphite.”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> An instance yet more
to our purpose occurs in the experiments made to try the
force of gunpowder. Leathern bags filled with sand are put
into the mortar that is to receive the cannon-ball at a distance
of fifty feet from the mouth of the gun; and the sand is
often compressed by the percussion of the ball into a solid
mass of Sandstone.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> Now the deposits of which we are
speaking cannot fail to be subjected to a very powerful and
a very constant compressing force. For, since the process
of deposition is always going on, the matter which is deposited
to-day will to-morrow be covered with a new layer, and
in the course of ages it may lie beneath an immense pile
of mineral matter, hundreds or even thousands of feet in
thickness.</p>

<p>But in fact there is another and more important agent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
at work. When the harder and more compact blocks of
Conglomerate and Sandstone are subjected to a close analysis
in the laboratory of the chemist, it is found that they are
strongly cemented together, sometimes by a solution of
lime filling up the interstices between the grains or pebbles,
sometimes by a solution of silica, sometimes by a solution
of iron. Now this discovery affords a useful clue when
we come to study the present operations of Nature. It is
to the agency of a mineral cement we must look for the
perfect consolidation of Mechanical Rocks. Let us see if
such a cement can be found.</p>

<p>It is well known that the water of rivers, lakes, and
springs, is more or less charged with carbonic acid gas;
and therefore, when it comes in contact with limestone, it
dissolves a portion of the lime and holds it in solution.
Hence it follows that in every part of the world there exists
an abundant store of calcareous cement. Again, our
readers must have observed the brownish, rusty color sometimes
produced by streams on the surface of rocks and
herbage. This is the result of the iron with which the
streams are impregnated: and we are informed by scientific
inquirers that water containing a solution of iron prevails
very generally in almost all countries. The solution of
silica in water is not so common; because pure silica cannot
be dissolved by water except at a very high temperature.
Nevertheless, it has been clearly demonstrated by observation,
that silica, where it occurs in certain combinations
with other mineral substances, may be dissolved readily
enough: for instance, in the decomposition of felspar,
and of all rocks in which felspar is an ingredient, silica is
carried off in a state of solution.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> And since these rocks
are very numerous, and distributed over every part of the
earth, we may fairly conclude that a solution of silica exists
very abundantly in nature.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>

<p>Now when we bear in mind that we have on the one
hand in the Crust of the Earth, solid strata of Conglomerate
and Sandstone, exhibiting the evident operation of
these mineral cements; and on the other hand, near the
surface, the loose materials of Conglomerate and Sandstone
as if ready to be cemented, and close at hand the cementing
mineral itself in a convenient form, it is not unreasonable
to assume that the process should actually take place;&mdash;that
water highly charged with iron, or lime, or silica,
should filter through the loose gravel and sand, depositing
its mineral cement as it passes along, and converting the
newly-formed strata into compact and solid rock.</p>

<p>But this conclusion does not rest upon antecedent probability
alone. We have proof unquestionable that a process
such as we have described is actually going on. In the
dredging of the river Thames large masses of solid Conglomerate
are found from time to time, firmly compacted
together by a ferruginous cement. And there is internal
evidence that the process of solidification has been effected
by natural causes within historic times; for it happens not
unfrequently that Roman coins and fragments of pottery
are found embedded in the solid block of stone. Similar
discoveries were made in deepening the bed of the river
Dove in Derbyshire, about the year 1832. Thousands of
silver coins were found about ten feet under the surface,
firmly cemented into a hard Conglomerate. Several of
these coins bear dates of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries;
and therefore the pebbles which form the rock must
have been deposited and converted into a solid mass since
that time. But we must not suppose that so long an interval
is necessary for the consolidation of rocks. In the
early part of the present century a vessel called the Thetis
was wrecked off cape Frio on the coast of Brazil. A few
months afterward, when an attempt was successfully made
to recover the dollars and other treasures which had gone
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
to the bottom with the wreck, they were found completely
enveloped in solid masses of quartzose Sandstone. The
materials of the newly-formed stone were in this case
manifestly derived from the granite rocks of the Brazilian
coast.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>In many parts of the Mediterranean, and along its
shores, this process is known to be going on with equal
rapidity. “The new-formed strata of Asia Minor,” writes
Sir Charles Lyell, “consists of stone, not of loose, incoherent
materials. Almost all the streamlets and rivers, like
many of those in Tuscany and the south of Italy, hold
abundance of carbonate of lime in solution, and precipitate
Travertine, or sometimes bind together the sand and gravel
into solid Sandstones and Conglomerates; every delta and
sandbar thus acquires solidity, which often prevents streams
from forcing their way through them, so that their mouths
are constantly changing their position.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> In the Museum
at Montpelier is exhibited a cannon embedded in a crystalline
calcareous rock which was taken up from the bed of
the Mediterranean near the mouth of the Rhone.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>To these examples of the solidification of rock within
recent times we are tempted to add one more, taken from
a Memoir published by the late Dr. Paris in the Transactions
of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall. “A
sandstone occurs in various parts of the northern coast of
Cornwall, which affords a most instructive example of a
recent formation, since we here actually detect Nature at
work in converting loose sand into solid rock. A very considerable
portion of the northern coast of Cornwall is covered
with calcareous sand, consisting of minute particles of
comminuted shells, which in some places has accumulated
in quantities so great, as to have formed hills of from forty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
to fifty feet in elevation. In digging into these sand-hills,
or upon the occasional removal of some part of them by
the winds, the remains of houses may be seen; and in
places where the churchyards have been overwhelmed, a
great number of human bones may be found. The sand is
supposed to have been originally brought from the sea by
hurricanes, probably at a remote period. It first appears
in a state of slight but increasing aggregation on several
parts of the shore in the Bay of St. Ives; but on approaching
the Gwythian River it becomes more extensive and
indurated.... It is around the promontory of New Kaye
that the most extensive formation of Sandstone takes place.
Here it may be seen in different stages of induration, from
a state in which it is too friable to be detached from the
rock on which it reposes, to a hardness so considerable
that it requires a very violent blow from a sledge to break
it. Buildings are constructed of it; the church of Cranstock
is entirely built with it; and it is also employed for
various articles of domestic and agricultural uses.”</p>

<p>No reasonable doubt can therefore remain that the loose
beds of gravel, sand, and clay, which, as we have already
seen, are deposited from day to day, and from year to year,
and from century to century, beneath the waters of the
ocean, may be converted in the course of time by natural
agents into solid rocks of Conglomerate, of Sandstone, and
of Shale. But this is not enough. It yet remains for us to
explain how these solid rocks come to be arranged in a series
of distinct layers or strata. The reader will remember that
the supply of materials in any given area of the ocean is not
fixed and continuous, but, on the contrary, variable and
intermittent. During the periodical rains within the tropics,
and during the melting of the snows in high latitudes or
in mountain regions, the rivers become enormously swollen,
and carry down a far greater quantity of sediment
than at other seasons. The waste of cliffs, too, by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
action of the waves, is much greater in winter than in
summer. Thus, while at one season a particular river or
current may be comparatively free from sediment, at another
it will carry along in its turbid course an almost
incredible freight of mineral matter. We have a notable
example in the case of the Ganges. The bulk of earthy
matter which this river discharges into the sea during the
four months of rain, averages about 50,000,000 of cubic
feet per day; whereas the daily discharge during the three
months of hot weather is considerably less than one hundredth
part of that amount.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>Besides this variety in the quantity of materials carried,
there is also a great variety in the velocity both of rivers and
of currents; and therefore they will not always carry the
same materials to the same distance; for the less rapid the
stream, the sooner will the sediment fall to the bottom.
We may add that currents, as is well known, often change
their direction from various causes, and thus at different
times they will carry the waste of the land to different parts
of the ocean.</p>

<p>From these considerations two conclusions may be fairly
deduced: First, that the process of deposition may often go
on very rapidly for a time over a given area, and then
altogether cease, and after an interval begin again. In this
way time may be allowed for one deposit to acquire more
or less consistency before the next is superimposed; and
thus a succession of distinct beds will be produced. Secondly,
we may infer that the same precise materials will
not always be deposited over the same area; at one time it
will be sand, at another gravel, at another clay, at another
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
some combination of these or other mineral substances.
And thus it may happen that the strata deposited in successive
periods of time shall not only be distinct one from
the other, but composed of different materials;&mdash;that there
shall be, in fact, as we so often see that there are, beds of
Conglomerate, Sandstone, Clay, Marl, and other rocks,
succeeding one another in every variety of order.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span> argument set forth in the last chapter is simple,
ingenious, and persuasive. Nay, we must fairly
confess that to us it seems conclusive. We do
not mean to say that it amounts to a rigorous demonstration.
But it affords at least a strong presumption that the
process of deposition, the process of consolidation, and the
process of stratification, are going on to a vast extent beneath
the waters of the ocean; and that, in these latter
ages of the world’s history, Aqueous Rocks are slowly
growing up under the influence of natural causes, which
resemble in every important feature those that are now
attracting so much attention within the Crust of the Earth.
We are therefore prepared to accept this conclusion, if it be
not found at variance with any well-established fact, or with
any known and certain truth. But in matters of physical
science the evidence of our senses is, after all, the most satisfactory
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
argument. And our readers, no doubt, would
like to witness, if possible, with their eyes, the building up
of Stratified Rocks. Now, though it is not given to us to
see this process in all its colossal magnitude as it goes on
within the depths of the mighty ocean, it is yet possible to
behold it exhibited, as it were, in miniature, in certain
cases where the sediment of rivers is deposited within reach
of observation.</p>

<p>Every one is familiar with the fact that many rivers overflow
their banks at certain seasons, and spread themselves
out over a wide area, sometimes reaching to the foot of
the hills that bound the valleys through which they flow.
This is the origin of those Alluvial Plains so remarkable
for their surpassing richness and fertility. In each successive
year a thin film of sediment is deposited on the surface
of the land; and thus in the course of ages a soil is formed
capable of producing, season after season, the most luxuriant
crops without manifesting any symptoms of exhaustion.
The soil of the Alluvial Plain near St. Louis, on the Mississippi,
is thus spoken of by a modern traveller: “As to the
quality of the land, any given number of crops might be
grown off it. Corn has been raised on it for a hundred
years together&mdash;as far back as the settlement is known.
To inquire about the system of farming in the West is not
productive of information which would be of service on the
continent of Europe. There is no system: the farmer
scratches the ground and throws in the seed, and his bountiful
harvests come up year after year without further thought
or trouble. Thousands of centuries have made the soil for
him, and it defies him to make too heavy demands upon it.
It gives him all he asks, and is never known to disappoint
or fail.”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>The great basin of the Nile offers an admirable example
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
of an Alluvial Plain on a scale of considerable magnitude.
Even in the days of Herodotus, Egypt was regarded as the
“gift of the Nile:” and the correctness of this opinion
has been placed beyond all reasonable doubt by the investigations
of modern science. The river bears along in its
current, especially during the flood season, a large quantity
of fine earthy sediment obtained by the process of Denudation
from the mountains of central Africa. Once a year,
between the months of July and November, it overflows its
banks, and this sediment is deposited on the adjoining
plains. Thus a new layer of rich soil is spread out every
year over the existing surface; and the whole country is, in
a manner, growing upward at the average rate, according
to a rough estimate, of about six inches in the century.
Near Cairo, where excavations have been made, the successive
layers of annual deposit are distinctly visible to the
eye. And it is worthy of remark that, although each one
of these is no thicker than a sheet of paste-board, the
stratum of alluvial soil which overlies the sands of the
desert, and which to all appearance has come into existence
by the very same process, is often forty, fifty, and even
sixty feet in depth.</p>

<p>A series of interesting observations and experiments have
been recently made under the auspices of the Royal Society,
which afford some useful information on this subject. The
colossal statue of Rameses, near Memphis, was found to be
partly embedded in a stratum of mud which had gradually
accumulated around it. Upon sinking a shaft, it was discovered
that from the present surface of the plain to the
base of the pedestal is a distance of nearly ten feet. Now,
Rameses flourished, according to Lepsius, about one thousand
three hundred and sixty years before the Christian
Era; and therefore, since that time, or within a space of
3200 years, it is pretty clear that a thickness of ten feet has
been added at this spot to the Alluvial Plain of the Nile.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
It is hard to resist the conclusion that the next stratum of
ten feet as we proceed downward, which, in every respect,
resembles the first, must have been produced in the same
way by natural causes; and so on till we reach the barren
sand of the desert, which is here just forty-two feet below
the present level of the plain.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p>It should seem, therefore, that Egypt is nothing more
than a great Alluvial Plain, slowly built up in the long
lapse of ages, by the annual inundations of the Nile.
Vast tracts of the same kind are to be found in other parts
of the world. The Mississippi, which drains about one-seventh
of the whole North American continent, has formed
an Alluvial Plain more than a thousand miles in length,
and from thirty to eighty in breadth. And in South America,
the Orinoco once a year spreads out its swollen and
turbid waters over an area not unfrequently seventy miles
broad; leaving behind, when it subsides, a substantial layer
of muddy sediment to enrich the soil.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> It would be easy
to accumulate examples. But we shall be content with
having referred the reader to the Great Basin of the Nile,
which affords special opportunities for the study of alluvial
phenomena; being illustrated at once by the historical
monuments of remote antiquity and the scientific researches
of recent times.</p>

<p>There is another process by which Alluvial Plains are
formed. It often happens that a river fills up the channel
in which it has been moving for years, and is forced to
shift its course and seek a new passage to the sea. In progress
of time this channel is filled up like the former and
deserted, and then a third, and then a fourth. At each
change a new stratum is formed, almost always distinguished
for its extraordinary fertility. This phenomenon is chiefly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
to be looked for when an extensive and almost level plain
lies between some lofty range of mountains and the sea.
In such a case, the river which bears away the waste of the
mountains, will move onward in its course with a sluggish
current, and will, of necessity, deposit the greater part of its
burden on the way. There is scarcely a country in the
world that does not abound in formations of this kind;
and we could point to many notable instances in which
herds of cattle are now grazing on the very spot where,
within quite recent times, the turbid waters of some great
stream flowed sullenly along.</p>

<p>The river Po, which receives through a thousand mountain
torrents an enormous quantity of mineral sediment
from the Alps, affords an instructive example. Since the
beginning of the fifteenth century it has many times changed
its course, often committing great devastations, and always
leaving behind unmistakable traces of its movements.
Several towns that once stood on the left bank of the river
are now on the right. In some instances parish churches
and religious houses were pulled down when the devouring
stream was seen slowly to approach, and then rebuilt with
the same materials at a greater distance. An old channel
may be easily recognized at the present day near Cremona,
which bears the name of Po Morto, and another called Po
Vecchio, in the territory of Parma.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to our readers to learn that these
movements have been checked in modern times. By a
system of artificial embankment the waters of the river are
now confined within definite and narrow limits: thus the
velocity of the current is increased and a very considerable
portion of the sediment is carried on to the sea. Nevertheless,
much is still deposited in the bed of the river, which
is, in consequence, raised higher and higher each successive
year. Hence it has become necessary, in order to
prevent inundations, to add every season to the height of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
the embankments, so that the river now presents the appearance
of an enormous aqueduct, of which some idea may
be formed from the fact that, in the neighborhood of Ferrara,
the surface of the stream is higher than the roofs of
the houses. This system of embankment is carried on
very extensively in Northern Italy to check the overflowing
of rivers, and to prevent them from changing their courses.
It is as old as the time of Dante, who tells us that the inhabitants
of Padua erected barriers along the Brenta when the
snows began to melt and the season of the floods was
approaching,</p>

<p>As a river sometimes fills up its own channel, so too may
it fill up a lake through which it flows, and convert it likewise
into a great Alluvial Plain. Thus it is said several
extensive lakes have been transformed into dry land in
modern times near Parma, Piacenza, and Cremona. Elsewhere
the process may be seen in actual operation. The
Rhone when it enters the lake of Geneva is a turbid discolored
stream; the natural consequence of the immense
quantity of earthy sediment with which it is charged. But
as it slowly moves along, the sediment falls to the bottom,
and when, at length, “by Leman’s waters washed,” it
emerges at the town of Geneva, and shoots beneath the
magnificent bridge that joins the opposite shores, it has
already assumed that beautiful azure blue which travellers
love to gaze on, and poets love to sing. The sediment left
behind goes to form a great alluvial tract which is slowly
but steadily advancing into the lake. An ancient town
called Port Vallais, which, eight centuries ago, stood at the
water’s edge, is now a mile and a half inland. And if the
world were to last long enough, and the natural agents at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
present in operation were to remain unchanged, the time
would come, we can scarcely doubt, when the whole lake
of Geneva would have been converted into an Alluvial
Plain of vast extent and inexhaustible fertility.</p>

<p>This last example leads us on to the phenomenon of
Deltas, which afford, perhaps, the best opportunity of observing
the actual formation of stratified rocks. Some large
rivers, as we have already seen, enter the sea with such extreme
velocity as to bear away their sediment to a distance
of several hundred miles from the land. But in other cases
the onward rush of the stream is much sooner arrested, and
the sediment, if it be not caught up by ocean currents, is
deposited near the mouth of the river, and forms a triangular
tract of alluvial land. This kind of deposit is called
a Delta, from the resemblance it bears to the letter (Δ) of
that name in the Greek Alphabet. The apex of the triangle
points up the stream, the base is toward the sea. Hence,
when a Delta is formed the river naturally divides into two
branches, one flowing to the right, the other to the left.
In progress of time new channels are almost always made,
and the great stream empties itself into the sea by many
mouths.</p>

<p>The Delta formed in the Bay of Bengal by the two great
rivers of India, the Ganges and the Brahmapootra, offers an
illustration of this phenomenon on a scale of unusual magnitude.
Indeed, strictly speaking, it is not one Delta only,
but rather two Deltas lying side by side; the one deriving
its origin from the Ganges, the other from the Brahmapootra.
This double Delta extends its base for two hundred
and fifty miles along the Bay of Bengal, and stretches inward
into the continent of India to an almost equal distance.
Here, then, is a vast tract of country manifestly
composed of earthy sediment, obtained by the process of
Denudation from the Himalayan mountains, and afterward
transported to its present site by the agency of moving
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
water. But the deposition of earthy matter does not suddenly
come to an end when we reach the present line of
the coast. The sea is visibly discolored by the sediment
far beyond the actual base of the Delta; and a sloping
bank of mud is found to stretch beneath the waters of the
Bay to a distance of a hundred miles.</p>

<p>Even within the short period of a man’s life the domain
of dry land is often visibly enlarged. Sandbanks are first
formed in some of those numerous winding channels
through which the two rivers find their way to the sea.
The sandbanks, receiving fresh accessions during each succeeding
flood, in a short time become islands; and the
islands have been known, in a few years, to attain a superficial
extent of many square miles. Then begins to appear
a wild and luxuriant vegetation&mdash;reeds, long grass,
shrubs, and trees; and those impenetrable thickets are
formed, to which the buffalo, the rhinoceros, and the tiger
soon resort for shelter. A very extensive tract of this kind,
adjoining the sea-coast, and known as the Sunderbunds, is
said to be as large as the principality of Wales.</p>

<p>The Delta of the Nile, though not quite one-half as large
as the Delta of the Ganges, presents nevertheless some
features of peculiar interest. In many places where a vertical
section is exposed to view, the phenomenon of stratification
may be distinctly recognized. The upper part
of the deposit belonging to each year is composed of
earth of a lighter color than the lower part; and the
whole forms a distinct layer of hardened clay, which may be
easily separated from those above and below. This formation,
therefore, corresponds exactly with those strata of
shale which we so often meet with in the Crust of the Earth.
Again, many of the old channels through which the Nile
made its way to the sea in ancient times, have been since
filled up and converted into solid land. The two extreme
arms of the river, which formerly enclosed the Delta, were two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
hundred miles apart where they entered the Mediterranean.
But these channels are now Alluvial Plains, and the base
of the Delta is but ninety miles in length. Hence, though
the quantity of land which has been formed by the sediment
of the Nile is much greater now than it formerly was, the
size of the Delta properly so called has not been increased
but diminished.</p>

<p>If we turn to the great continent of America, we are met
by results not less striking and important. The Delta of
the Mississippi is two hundred miles in length, and one
hundred and forty in breadth. This vast stratum of mud
is between five and six hundred feet thick, and covers an
area twelve thousand square miles in extent. Each year it
receives from the great <i>Father of Rivers</i> a new accession of
sediment which is computed at 3,700,000,000 of cubic
feet. And besides this annual deposit of inorganic matter,
we must not omit from our estimate the countless trees of
various species and of gigantic size, which are torn up by
the floods, carried along by the impetuous stream, and
buried at last with the bones of animals, and works of human
art, and other spoils of the land, in the mud of the
Delta at the river’s mouth.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span> Aqueous Rocks of which we have spoken in
the last two chapters are called by Geologists
Mechanical; inasmuch as they owe their existence
chiefly to the agency of Mechanical force. It should
be observed, however, that a very considerable share in the
production of these rocks must be ascribed, not unfrequently,
to Chemical influence. Chemical action helps to
prepare the materials of which they are composed; and
Chemical action likewise furnishes the calcareous, siliceous,
and other mineral cements by which they are, in a great
measure, consolidated. There is, however, a second class
of Aqueous Rocks which are produced almost exclusively
by the operation of Chemical laws, and which we have
accordingly denominated Stratified Rocks of Chemical
Origin. It is of these that we purpose to speak in the
present chapter. They constitute a much smaller proportion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
of the Earth’s Crust than either the Mechanical or the
Organic Rocks. But the history of their formation is
curious and instructive. We shall confine ourselves to one
or two simple and familiar illustrations.</p>

<p>In the course of these illustrations we shall have a good
deal to say about Carbonate of Lime in a state of solution;
and it may perhaps be useful to explain, first of all, what is
meant by a solution, in the technical language of Chemistry.
If a spoonful of salt is put into a tumbler of water, the particles
of salt, after a little time, cease to cohere together,
and become so diffused through the water as to be no longer
visible to the eye, although their presence in every part may
be easily discerned by the taste. The salt is then said to be
<i>dissolved</i>, and the water in which it is dissolved is called a
<i>solution</i> of salt. It is important to distinguish the case of a
solution from the case of a mere mechanical mixture. If,
instead of the salt, we were to put into the tumbler of water
a spoonful of very fine sand, then we should have a <i>mixture</i>
but not a <i>solution</i>. By stirring briskly the contents of the
tumbler we might, indeed, effect a very close union between
the particles of water and the particles of sand: but this
union would be altogether different in kind from the union
that was observed in the former case between the particles
of water and the particles of salt. First, the sand would
remain visible to the eye, making the water turbid and discolored;
whereas the salt entirely disappeared, leaving the
water limpid and transparent as before. Again, if the water
be allowed to rest, the sand will in time fall to the bottom,
whereas the salt will not.</p>

<p>But there is a limit to the capacity of water for holding
salt in solution. If spoonful after spoonful be added, it
will be found, when a certain point has been reached, that
the water can at length dissolve no more. It is then called
a <i>saturated solution</i> of salt. If, in this case, a portion of the
water were to pass away by evaporation, it is clear, we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
should have the same quantity of salt as before, in a smaller
quantity of water. The consequence would be that <i>all</i> the
salt could not then be held in solution, and some of it
would fall to the bottom; or, in chemical language, a precipitate
of salt would be formed on the bottom of the tumbler.
Now, according to the theory of Geologists, many
rocks, hundreds of feet thick, and solid enough to form the
walls of our palaces, our churches, and our castles, have
been produced in the Crust of the Earth by just such a
process as this. In support of their theory we are about to
show that the process is actually going on in our own time,
and is open to the examination of all who may desire to
study it for themselves.</p>

<p>We shall begin with the formation of Stalactites and
Stalagmites. The mode in which these singular masses of
rock are brought into existence is very clearly explained,
and the picturesque appearance they so often present to the
eye is very graphically described, by Dr. Mantell, in his
Wonders of Geology, from which the following passages
are taken:&mdash;“One of the most common appearances in
limestone caverns is the formation of what are called
Stalactites, from a Greek word signifying distillation or
dropping. Whenever water filters through a limestone
rock it dissolves a portion of it; and on reaching any
opening, such as a cavern, oozes from the sides or roof,
and forms a drop, the moisture of which is soon evaporated
by the air, and a small circular plate or ring of
calcareous matter remains; another drop succeeds in the
same place, and adds, from the same cause, a fresh coat of
incrustation. In time, these successive additions produce
a long, irregular, conical projection from the roof, which
is generally hollow, and is continually being increased by
the fresh accession of water, loaded with calcareous or
chalky matter: this is deposited on the outside of the
Stalactite already formed, and, trickling down, adds to its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
length by subsiding to the point, and evaporating as before;
precisely in the same manner as, during frosty weather,
icicles are formed on the edges of the eaves of a roof.
When the supply of water holding lime in solution is too
rapid to allow of its evaporation at the bottom of the
Stalactite, it drops on the floor of the cave, and drying up
gradually, forms in like manner a Stalactite rising upward
from the ground, instead of hanging from the roof; this is
called for the sake of distinction Stalagmite.</p>

<p>“It frequently happens, where these processes are uninterrupted,
that a Stalactite hanging from the roof, and a
Stalagmite formed immediately under it from the super-abundant
water, increase until they unite, and thus constitute
a natural pillar, apparently supporting the roof of the
grotto. It is to the grotesque forms assumed by Stalactites
and these natural columns, that caverns owe the interesting
appearances described in such glowing terms by those who
witness them for the first time. One of the most beautiful
stalactitic caverns in England is at Clapham, near Ingleborough.
In the Cheddar Cliffs, Somersetshire, there has
been discovered a similar cave richly incrusted with sparry
concretions. There are others in Derbyshire.</p>

<p>“The grotto of Antiparos in the Grecian Archipelago,
not far from Paros, has long been celebrated. The sides
and roof of its principal cavity are covered with immense
incrustations of calcareous spar, which form either Stalactites
depending from above or irregular pillars rising from the
floor. Several perfect columns reaching to the ceiling
have been formed and others are still in progress, by the
union of the Stalactite from above with the Stalagmite
below. These, being composed of matter slowly deposited,
have assumed the most fantastic shapes; while the pure,
white, and glittering spar beautifully catches and reflects
the light of the torches of the visitors to this subterranean
palace, in a manner which causes all astonishment to cease
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
at the romantic tales told of the place&mdash;of its caves of
diamonds and of its ruby walls; the simple truth, when
deprived of all exaggeration, being sufficient to excite
admiration and awe.</p>

<p>“Sometimes a linear fissure in the roof, by the direction
it gives to the dropping of the lapidifying water, forms a
perfectly transparent curtain or partition. A remarkable
instance of this kind occurs in a cavern in North America
called Wyer’s Cave. This cave is situated in a ridge of
limestone hills running parallel to the Blue Mountains.
A narrow and rugged fissure leads to a large cavern, where
the most grotesque figures, formed by the percolation of
water through beds of limestone, present themselves, while
the eye, glancing onward, watches the dim and distant
glimmers of the lights of the guides&mdash;some in the recess
below, and others in the galleries above. Passing from
these recesses, the passage conducts to a flight of steps that
leads into a large cavern of irregular form and of great
beauty. Its dimensions are about thirty feet by fifty. Here
the incrustations hang just like a sheet of water that was
frozen as it fell; there they rise into a beautiful stalactite
pillar; and yonder compose an elevated seat, surrounded
by sparry pinnacles. Beyond this room is another more
irregular, but more beautiful; for besides having sparry
ornaments in common with the others, the roof overhead
is of the most admirable and singular formation. It is
entirely covered with Stalactites, which are suspended from
it like inverted pinnacles; and they are of the finest material,
and most beautifully shaped and embossed. In
another apartment an immense sheet of transparent Stalactite,
which extends from the floor to the roof, emits, when
struck, deep and mellow sounds like those of a muffled
drum.</p>

<p>“Farther on is another vaulted chamber, which is one
hundred feet long, thirty-six wide, and twenty-six high. Its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
walls are filled with grotesque concretions. The effect of
the lights placed by the guides at various elevations, and
leaving hidden more than they reveal, is extremely fine.
At the extremity of another range of apartments, a magnificent
hall, two hundred and fifty feet long, and thirty-three
feet high, suddenly appears. Here is a splendid sheet of
rock-work running up the centre of the room, and giving
it the aspect of two separate and noble galleries. This
partition rises twenty feet above the floor, and leaves the
fine span of the arched roof untouched. There is here a
beautiful concretion, which has the form and drapery of a
gigantic statue; and the whole place is filled with stalagmitical
masses of the most varied and grotesque character.
The fine perspective of this room, four times the length of
an ordinary church, and the amazing vaulted roof spreading
overhead, without any support of pillar or column, produce
a most striking effect. In another apartment, which has an
altitude of fifty feet, there is at one end an elevated recess
ornamented with a group of pendant Stalactites of unusual
size and singular beauty. They are as large as the pipes
of a full-sized organ, and ranged with great regularity:
when struck they emit mellow sounds of various keys, not
unlike the tones of musical glasses. The length of this
extraordinary group of caverns is not less than one thousand
six hundred feet.”</p>

<p>In the case of Stalactites and Stalagmites the actual formation
of limestone by the influence of Chemical action is
brought home forcibly to the mind, and, in a manner,
made palpable to the senses. We shall now pass to other
examples in which the process is scarcely less open to observation,
and in which the limestone assumes a somewhat
more massive and rock-like form. Every one who has
been in Italy is familiar with the limestone rock called
Travertine. It is seen in the ancient walls and the venerable
temples of P&aelig;stum, which have withstood unharmed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
the wasting hand of time for upward of twenty centuries.
In Rome, too, this stone is associated in our minds as well
with the enduring monuments of antiquity, as with the
imposing splendor of Christian art. The Coliseum, the
most stupendous of ruins, and St. Peter’s, the most sublime
of temples, are built of Travertine. In fact it seems to
have been, in every age, the chief building stone employed
in the architecture of the Eternal City; and the quarries
from which it was taken in ancient times may still be seen
at Ponte Lucano, near Tivoli. Now it is an interesting
fact, that close to this very spot, at the Solfatara lake on the
one side, and at Tivoli itself on the other, the formation of
Travertine is going on in our own time, by the precipitation
of lime from a state of solution.</p>

<p>The Solfatara lake, situated about fourteen miles from
Rome, on the road to Tivoli, is supplied with an unfailing
stream of tepid water, impregnated with carbonic acid gas
and saturated with carbonate of lime. The amount of
carbonate of lime which the water is capable of holding
in solution depends chiefly on three things: first, on the
presence of carbonic acid; secondly, on the high temperature
of the water; and thirdly, on its quantity. Now
the carbonic acid is ever rising in bubbles to the surface
and passing away; the temperature of the water is lowered
by contact with the cooler atmosphere; and its quantity is
diminished by evaporation. Thus the capacity which the
water at first had for holding the carbonate of lime in solution
is notably diminished, and a part of the lime is precipitated
to the bottom in a solid form, or clings to the
vegetable matter with which it comes in contact.</p>

<p>A very simple and interesting experiment, made in the
early part of the present century by Sir Humphrey Davy,
will illustrate the rapidity with which the formation of solid
stone is even now taking place. In the month of May he
fixed a stick in the bed of the lake, and left it standing until
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
the following April, when he found that it was covered with
an incrustation of limestone several inches thick.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> In
precisely the same way new layers of Travertine are annually
deposited in the bed of the lake, and incrusted on its
rocky margin; and so the lake itself is becoming smaller and
smaller from year to year. We are told that in the middle
of the seventeenth century it was a mile in circuit, and now
it is a little more than a quarter of a mile.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> Here, therefore,
we have an immense mass of compact limestone rock, built
up by natural agents within the last two centuries.</p>

<p>At Tivoli, about four miles beyond the Solfatara, and
two miles from the quarries of Ponte Lucano, phenomena
of the same kind are exhibited. The waters of the Anio,
which are saturated with carbonate of lime, form incrustations
of Travertine on the banks of the river; and at the
celebrated falls, where the whole volume of the stream leaps
at a bound from a height of three hundred and twenty feet,
the most beautiful stalactites are formed by the foam.</p>

<p>The formation of Travertine is going on with no less
activity in other parts of the Italian Peninsula. At the
baths of San Filippo, in Tuscany, there are three warm
springs which contain a very large amount of mineral
matter in solution. The water which supplies the baths
falls into a pond, where it has been known to deposit a
solid stratum of rock <i>thirty feet thick</i> in twenty years. In
the same neighborhood are the mineral baths of San Vignone.
The source from which the water flows is situated
on the summit of a hill not more than a few hundred yards
from the high road between Sienna and Rome; and so
rapid is the formation of stone, that half a foot of solid
Travertine is deposited every year in the pipe that conducts
the water to the baths. At this spot we have a very good
illustration of the argument we are now considering. As
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
the stream of water flows down the slopes of the hill, a thin
layer of Travertine rock is produced on the surface of the
earth, almost before our eyes; and so it was previous to our
own time, and so it has been for ages, as history and tradition
testify. The quantity produced in each year and in each
century is comparatively small, but we can have no doubt
that it <i>has</i> been produced by the means described. Now,
beneath the surface of the Earth, immediately below these
modern formations, of which we have so clearly ascertained
the origin, we find strata of the same kind, composed of
the same materials, and arranged in the same way, layer
resting upon layer, down to a depth of two hundred feet:
and the Geologist accounts for the formation of the one
according to the same laws which he has seen at work in
the production of the other.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

science. Indeed we are convinced that a simple narrative
of the researches which have recently been made upon
this subject, and the discoveries to which these researches
have led, would be no less attractive, and scarcely less
wonderful, than a fairy tale. But it is not for us to wander
at large over this vast and tempting field of inquiry. We
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
must be content with one or two examples, which may help
to illustrate the process of inductive reasoning upon which
the general principles of geological science are founded.</p>

<p>It is argued, then, that the present operations of Nature
afford the best key for the interpretation of her works in
bygone times. We observe various beds of rocks now in
course of formation on the surface of the Earth; and
within the Crust of the Earth we discover corresponding
strata of the self-same rock already complete, and laid by,
as it were, in Nature’s storehouse. Side by side, therefore,
we may study and compare the finished work and the work
that is yet in progress; and if, on a close examination, they
are found to agree in all essential characters, we have
doubtless a strong presumption, that the same causes which
are now producing the one, must in former times have produced
the other. This line of argument we have already
considered in reference to those two classes of Aqueous
Rocks, which are said to be respectively of Mechanical and
of Chemical origin. We now proceed to show that it is no
less applicable to those which are called Organic. And although
we may not hope to unfold all the secret wonders of
Nature’s laboratory, that have come to light in recent times,
yet we may afford a passing glimpse at her operations, which
can scarcely fail to be interesting and instructive.</p>

<p>We have shown how strata of solid rock are sometimes
formed in lakes by the precipitation of lime from a state of
solution. Now this process cannot take place in the sea;
for though lime is present in the sea, the quantity of carbonic
acid with which it is there associated, is far more than
sufficient to render its precipitation impossible.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> But
Nature has another contrivance for gathering together the
solid elements of her building. The depths of the ocean
are teeming with life; and countless tribes of minute
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
animals are furnished with the power of extracting the lime
from the waters they inhabit, and of reproducing it under a
new form. Sometimes, through this mysterious operation
of organic life, the lime is converted into a calcareous shell,
like that of the oyster; sometimes into a stony skeleton, as
in the case of the numerous families of coral-producing
animalcules. After death the soft, fleshy substance of these
animals melts away and disappears; but the limestone shells
and skeletons remain, accumulating during the long course
of ages to an almost incredible extent. And, if we are to
believe Geologists, out of these accumulated materials,
sometimes preserving their original form and structure,
sometimes altered more or less by chemical action, sometimes
broken up into fragments by mechanical force, has
been produced a very large proportion of the limestone
rocks which occur so abundantly in the Crust of the Earth.</p>

<p>No better illustration can be found than the white earthy
limestone, familiar to every one under the name of chalk.
An undulating stratum of Chalk Rock, attaining not unfrequently
a thickness of one thousand feet, may be said,
speaking roughly, to underlie the southeastern half of
England. Sometimes it appears at the surface: sometimes
it dips downward, and forms a kind of great basin, over
which are regularly spread out various other groups of
Stratified Rocks. On the southern coast it rises to a height
of several hundred feet above the level of the sea in a line
of perpendicular cliffs, conspicuous from a distance by their
dazzling whiteness. But the White Chalk of England is
only an insignificant part of a great rock-formation, which
may be traced over extensive areas throughout all Europe,
from Ireland to the Crimea, from the Baltic Sea to the Bay
of Biscay; and which everywhere preserves in a remarkable
degree the same mineral character, and presents to the eye
the same general appearance.</p>

<p>Now it had often been suggested by Geologists that this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
wide-spread formation derived its existence chiefly from the
accumulated remains of organic life. For in many instances
the broken shells of minute animalcules could be distinctly
observed to constitute a part of the rock. And even where
the organic structure could not be so clearly traced, the
carbonate of lime composing the Chalk presented just that
appearance which would naturally result from the decomposition
of such shells. This theory, however, was long
put forward with diffidence and received with incredulity.
Even scientific men found it hard to persuade themselves
that a solid rock of such great extent and thickness could
have been the work of agents apparently so insignificant.
But it has been confirmed and illustrated in a very interesting
and unexpected manner within the last few years.</p>

<p>When the project of connecting Europe and America by
a telegraph cable was first set on foot, it became necessary
to ascertain, as far as possible, the general configuration of
the ocean bottom and the exact nature of the bed on which
the cable was to lie. Accordingly in the year 1857 an expedition
was fitted out for this purpose under the command
of Captain Dayman; and a careful series of soundings was
taken between Valentia, on the West Coast of Kerry, and
Trinity Bay on the shores of Newfoundland. It was found
that the floor of the ocean between Ireland and America is a
vast irregular plain, and that by far the greater part is covered
over with a kind of soft mud or ooze. Samples of this
ooze were scooped up, even at the most profound depths,
by means of an ingenious apparatus attached to the sounding-lines,
and brought undisturbed to the surface. Afterward
they were carried home to England and submitted for
examination to Professor Huxley. The result has been to
show that the materials of a limestone rock, resembling in
every essential feature the White Chalk of Europe, are
being spread out at the present day over an area of immense
extent on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<p>With the permission of our readers we shall allow Professor
Huxley, as far as may be, to tell his own story.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>
As to the ocean floor itself, “It is,” he says, “a prodigious
plain&mdash;one of the widest and most even plains in the world.
If the sea were drained off, you might drive a wagon all the
way from Valentia to Trinity Bay. And, except upon one
sharp incline about two hundred miles from Valentia, I am
not quite sure that it would even be necessary to put the skid
on, so gentle are the ascents and descents upon that long
route. From Valentia the road would lie down hill for
about two hundred miles to the point at which the bottom
is now covered by 1700 fathoms of sea-water. Then would
come the central plain, more than a thousand miles wide,
the inequalities of the surface of which would be hardly
perceptible, though the depth of water upon it now varies
from 10,000 to 15,000 feet; and there are places in which
Mont Blanc might be sunk without showing its peak
above water. Beyond this the ascent on the American side
commences, and gradually leads for about three hundred
miles, to the Newfoundland shore.”</p>

<p>The central plain here described, which has been since
found to extend many hundred miles north and south of
the cable line, is covered almost everywhere by that soft,
mealy sort of mud of which we have already spoken; and
this, it is now confidently believed, is nothing else than a stratum
of Chalk Rock in an early stage of formation. When
thoroughly dried it assumes a whitish color, and exhibits
a texture which even to the superficial observer appears
closely to resemble fine chalk. Nay, we are told that if so
disposed, one may take a bit of it in his fingers and write
with it upon a blackboard. Like chalk, too, when chemically
analyzed it is found to be almost pure carbonate of
lime.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

<p>But there is a yet more striking analogy between the
mud of the Atlantic and the White Chalk of Europe.
Both have been submitted to the magnifying power of the
Microscope; and, after an examination conducted with
scrupulous care, a wonderful and almost startling identity
of mineral, or rather we should say of organic, composition
has been established between them. To the naked eye
Chalk is simply a soft, earthy sort of stone. But when a
thin transparent slice is placed under the Microscope, the
general mass is found to be made up of very minute particles,
in which are embedded a vast number of other bodies
possessing a well-defined form and structure. These are of
various sizes, but on a rough average may be said not to
exceed a hundredth of an inch in diameter. Hundreds of
thousands of them are sometimes contained in a cubic
inch of Chalk, together with countless millions of the more
minute granules.</p>

<p>Professor Huxley succeeded in separating these bodies
from the mass of granules in which they were embedded,
and by examining them apart, he has ascertained still more
fully their exact structure and composition. “Each one of
them,” he says, “is a beautifully constructed calcareous
fabric, made up of a number of chambers communicating
freely with one another. They are of various forms. One
of the commonest is something like a badly-grown raspberry,
being formed of a number of nearly globular chambers
of different sizes congregated together. It is called
Globigerina; and some specimens of Chalk consist of little
else than Globigerin&aelig; and granules.”</p>

<p>Previous to 1857 the Globigerin&aelig; of the Chalk were a
matter of no small controversy among Geologists and
Naturalists. Some contended that they were the organic
remains&mdash;the shells or skeletons&mdash;of ancient animalcules.
Others were disposed to regard them simply as aggregations
of lime, which, so to speak, chanced to assume the form of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
these little chambered bodies; though it was not easy to
explain, on this hypothesis, how these chance concretions,
however much they varied in size, preserved over the whole
of Europe the same exact form and structure. But the
controversy is now at an end. The specimens of the Atlantic
ooze brought home by Captain Dayman, when examined
under the higher powers of the Microscope, are found,
like Chalk, to be composed almost entirely of Globigerin&aelig;.
And that no doubt may remain as to their organic origin,
a portion of the fleshy integument of the little animalcules
is seen, in many cases, still adhering to the calcareous
skeleton.</p>

<p>“Globigerin&aelig; of every size,” we are told, “from the
smallest to the largest, are associated together in the Atlantic
mud, and the chambers of many are filled by a soft
animal matter. This soft substance is, in fact, the remains
of the creature to which the Globigerina shell, or rather
skeleton, owes its existence&mdash;and which is an animal of the
simplest imaginable description. It is, in fact, a mere
particle of living jelly, without defined parts of any kind&mdash;without
a mouth, nerves, muscles, or distinct organs; and
only manifesting its vitality to ordinary observation by
thrusting out and retracting, from all parts of its surface,
long filamentous processes which serve for arms and legs.
Yet this amorphous particle, devoid of everything which, in
the higher animals we call organs, is capable of feeding,
growing, and multiplying; of separating from the ocean
the small proportion of carbonate of lime which is dissolved
in sea-water; and of building up that substance into a skeleton
for itself, according to a pattern which can be imitated
by no other known agency.”</p>

<p>That the same process is going on in other parts of the
ocean appears by observations made by Sir Leopold
M’Clintock during the cruise of the Bulldog in 1860. He
discovered that a calcareous ooze having the consistency
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
of putty is spread out over extensive areas between the Faroe
Islands and Iceland, and also between Iceland and
Greenland. Of this mud about ninety-five per cent. is
composed of Globigerin&aelig;, which in some instances were
brought up actually living to the surface, and busily engaged
in secreting, by their vital powers, carbonate of lime
from the waters of the sea.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>Professor Huxley goes yet one step further in following
out the resemblance between the Chalk Rock that exists in
the Crust of the Earth and the stratum of Chalk that is now
growing up in the depths of the Atlantic. Not only are
the Globigerin&aelig;, of which the one is in great part composed,
identical with the animalcules that make up about
nine-tenths of the other, but even the minute granules that
constitute the residue of each formation, correspond in a
very remarkable manner. “In working over the soundings
collected by Captain Dayman, I was surprised to find
that many of what I have called the Granules of that mud
were not, as one might have been tempted to think at first,
the mere powder and waste of Globigerin&aelig;, but they had a
definite form and size. I termed these bodies Coccoliths,
and doubted their organic nature. Doctor Wallich verified
my observation, and added the interesting discovery that,
not unfrequently, bodies similar to these Coccoliths were
aggregated together into spheroids, which he termed Coccospheres.
So far as we knew, these bodies, the nature of
which is extremely puzzling and problematical, were peculiar
to the Atlantic soundings.</p>

<p>“But a few years ago Mr. Sorby, in making a careful
examination of the Chalk by means of thin sections and
otherwise, observed, as Ehrenberg had done before him,
that much of its granular basis possesses a definite form.
Comparing these formed particles with those in the Atlantic
soundings, he found the two to be identical; and thus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
proved that the Chalk, like the soundings, contains these
mysterious Coccoliths and Coccospheres. Here was a further
and a most interesting confirmation, from internal
evidence, of the essential identity of the Chalk with modern
deep-sea mud.”</p>

<p>We may, therefore, set it down as certain, first, that the
formation of Chalk Rock is going on very extensively at
the present day; and secondly, that the chief agency employed
in its production is no other than the vital action of
minute animalcules. This is no longer merely a plausible
theory or an ingenious hypothesis: it is simply a matter of
fact ascertained by direct observation. If then it is just and
philosophical to ascribe like effects to like causes, the conclusion
is plain that the White Chalk of Europe came into
existence in some far distant age by just such a process as
that which is now in operation on the bed of the Atlantic
Ocean.</p>

<p>From the Chalk mud of the Atlantic we will now pass to
the Coral Reefs that are growing up beneath the waters of
the Pacific and the Indian Oceans. Every one has heard of
Coral Reefs and Coral Islands; yet we fancy many persons
have but vague and indefinite notions about them. We
shall, therefore, in the first place, give a brief account of
their general appearance, their extent, and their geographical
distribution. Afterward we shall give some of the
evidence which goes to show that these huge masses of
rock owe their existence to the organic powers of minute
living animalcules.</p>

<p>The Coral Reef is familiar to the navigator of tropical
seas under a great variety of forms, and in many different
stages of development. In one case it is a chain of hidden
rocks rising not quite to the level of the sea; in another it
appears just above the waters, but is washed over by each
returning tide; while in another it rises up beyond the
reach of the waves, is clothed with luxuriant vegetation,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
and inhabited by various species of animals, even by man
himself. Again there is great diversity of outline among
these rocks, whether they are sunk beneath the surface of
the waters or lifted above them. But all may be reduced
to four classes, of which we propose to give a short description.</p>

<p>First is the Atoll, or lagoon island. It is a circular strip
of limestone rock enclosing a shallow lake within, and surrounded
by a deep and often unfathomable ocean without.
The scene presented by some of these circular reefs is described
by travellers as equally striking for its singularity
and its beauty. “A strip of land a few hundred yards wide
is covered by lofty cocoa-nut trees, above which is the blue
vault of heaven. This band of verdure is bounded by a
beach of glittering white sand, the outer margin of which is
encircled with a ring of snow-white breakers, beyond which
are the dark heaving waters of the ocean. The inner beach
encloses the still clear water of the lagoon, resting in its
greater part on white sand, and, when illuminated by a
vertical sun, of a most vivid green.”</p>

<p>These lagoon islands are often found in groups stretching,
with little interruption, for many hundred miles across
the ocean. The Maldives, for example, which lie a little
distance to the southwest of Hindostan, form a continuous
chain, running due north and south, four hundred and
seventy miles in length and fifty miles in breadth. Each
successive link in this chain does not consist, as might be
supposed, of a single circular reef, but it is rather a ring of
small coral islets, sometimes more than a hundred in number,
each of which is itself a perfect Atoll or lagoon island
such as we have just described. Of these miniature islets
many are from three to five miles in diameter; while the
larger rings of which they form a part are from thirty to
fifty. The Laccadive islands, a little more to the north,
exhibit a similar arrangement, and indeed would seem to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
be a continuation of the same group. In the Pacific are
found some chains of coral islands yet more extensive; as
for instance the Dangerous Archipelago, which is upward
of eleven hundred miles in length, and from three to four
hundred in breadth; but the islands within these spaces are
thinly scattered, and insignificant in size.</p>

<p>Sometimes the annular strip of coral rock encloses within
itself a lofty island, which rises up from the centre of the
lagoon. In this case it is called an Encircling Reef; the
lagoon being simply a broad channel surrounding the island
in the centre, and encompassed itself by the coral rock. An
example occurs in the island of Vanikoro, celebrated for
the shipwreck of La Peyrouse, where the Encircling Reef
runs at a distance of two or three miles from the shore, the
channel between it and the land having a general depth of
between two and three hundred feet. The well-known
mountainous island of Tahiti in the South Pacific Ocean is
also encompassed by an Encircling Reef, from which it is
separated by a broad belt of tranquil water.</p>

<p>A third class of Coral Reefs consists of those which run
parallel to the shores of continents or great islands, from
which they are cut off by a broad channel, to which the
sea has free access through certain open passages in the
rock. They are called Barrier Reefs; and differ from the
former only in this, that they do not surround the land, but
run parallel to it at a distance of some miles. The Great
Barrier Reef of Australia offers a noble example. It has
been described as a huge, massive, submarine wall or terrace,
fronting the northeastern coast of that continent, varying
from ten to ninety miles in breadth, and extending, with
some trifling interruptions, to a length of 1250 miles.
Another reef of the same kind, 400 miles in length, faces
the western coast of the long narrow island of New Caledonia.</p>

<p>When a chain of Coral rocks approaches close to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
shore, so as to leave no intervening channel of deep water,
they are called Fringing Reefs; and these constitute the
fourth and last class of the Coral formation. They prevail
everywhere in tropical regions, and appear as banks of
Coral encrusting the rocky shores of islands and continents.</p>

<p>As regards the geographical distribution of Coral Reefs,
the first circumstance that claims our notice, is that they
are exclusively confined to the warmer regions of the globe.
They exist in great profusion within the tropics, and are
rarely to be found beyond the thirtieth parallels of latitude
on each side of the Equator. The only remarkable
exception is in the case of the Bermuda Islands in 32&deg;
north latitude; but here, it is to be observed, the ocean is
warmed by the waters of the Gulf Stream. Another singular
fact is the almost total absence of Coral Reefs from the
Atlantic Ocean. In fact, the Bermudas, we believe, constitute
here again the only exception. The Pacific, on the
contrary, is wonderfully productive of coral; also the
Indian Ocean, the Persian and Arabian Gulfs, and the Red
Sea.</p>

<p>It may gratify, perhaps, the curiosity of some readers, if
we add a word on the Red Coral which is now so favorite
an ornament in the fashionable world. Though it never
attains to the magnitude of those reefs and islands we have
been describing, it partakes nevertheless of the same
peculiar structure; and no doubt is entertained that, like
them, it derives its existence from animal life, in the manner
we shall presently explain. It is produced chiefly in the
Mediterranean, in the Red Sea, and in the Persian Gulf;
and is brought up from the great depths by means of a
grappling apparatus attached to boats. The largest pieces
have a shrub-like branching form, and are supposed to
grow to the height of one foot in about eight years.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span></p>

<p>So much for the existence of the Coral Formation. Next
comes the question of its origin, with which, of course,
we are chiefly concerned. It is now the received belief of
all distinguished Naturalists, that these huge and wide-spread
masses of limestone rock, against which the breakers
of the ocean are ever thundering in vain, are the work
of tiny marine animalcules, and chiefly of those seemingly
insignificant creatures known by the name of Polyps or
Zoophytes. The Zoophyte, they tell us, is a mason who
himself produces the stones that he employs in his building.
“He has neither plane, nor chisel, nor trowel; there is no
sound of hammer in his city. He erects mighty and
enduring edifices, yet has no mechanical power by which
to raise his rocks to their summits. He can answer thee
nothing&mdash;no tongue, no eyes, no hands, no brains has he&mdash;yet
from the caves of old ocean has he raised that which
fills you with admiration.”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> Surely if all this be true, these
countless myriads of animalcules call aloud to us from the
depths of the ocean in language that cannot be mistaken:
“Know ye that the Lord He is God; it is He that hath
made us, and not we ourselves.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p>The Zoophyte belongs to the simplest form of the animal
creation. Its body consists merely of a pouch or stomach,
with tentacles arranged round the margin, which it can extend
at pleasure to supply itself with food. In many species
the individuals grow together on a common stem, from
which new members are constantly shooting forth like buds
from the branches of a tree. Hence the origin of the
name Zoophyte, which literally means a plant-like animal.
The common stem on which they grow is sometimes composed
of a horny substance, but more generally it is pure
carbonate of lime, which they secrete by the powers of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
organic action from the waters of the sea. It forms,
therefore, a kind of internal skeleton or framework, to
which the soft, gelatinous parts of the animal adhere,
pretty much as, in the case of other animals, the flesh
adheres to the bones. Thus we have, as it were, a community
of living creatures, growing together upon one
common stony framework, called a Polypidom or Polyp
edifice, which they themselves build by the very fact of
living.</p>

<p>The peculiar structure of these wonderful little communities
may perhaps be made more intelligible by the
aid of a few illustrations. Figure 4 exhibits the branching
skeleton and, at the extremities of the branches, the
several Polyps by whose vital action the skeleton has been
constructed. Some of the animalcules are shown in a state
of activity, with their tiny arms spread out in search of
food: others are withdrawn within their cells, and appear in
a state of repose. This species of Zoophyte, which is
highly magnified in the figure, flourishes abundantly on
the shores of Ireland and England. It has received the
name of Campanularia, from the bell-like form of its
cells. Our next cut represents a Gorgonia from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
Mediterranean, which is also considerably magnified. The
fleshy integument of this specimen is of a brilliant red
color: the Polyps are arranged in rows on each side of the
stem, and are shown in a state of expansion.</p>

<p>A mass of Coral animalcules, which are known by the
name of Frustra Pilosa, is represented of the natural size
in Figure 6. To the naked eye it seems like a piece of
fine net-work, disposed around a fragment of sea-weed,
which may be observed protruding in the upper part of our
illustration. With the aid of an ordinary magnifier the
net-like surface is seen to abound in minute pores arranged
with much regularity. Each of these pores is the cell of
a Zoophyte. And if a fragment of Frustra be examined
with a powerful microscope, when immersed in sea-water,
the curious little inhabitants themselves may be seen darting
in and out of their cells, expanding and contracting their
long feelers, and exhibiting altogether a wonderful activity.
In the adjoining woodcut, Figure 7, is shown another
interesting species of the arborescent Zoophyte. It belongs
to the family of Madrepores, and abounds in almost
all Coral Reefs. Alive under water it appears clothed in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
gelatinous coating of rich and varied hues. But when
removed from its native element this gelatinous coating,
which is the living animal substance, quickly melts away;
and, in some instances, runs off from the calcareous skeleton
in a kind of watery slime.</p>

<div id="fig_8" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_8.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 8.&mdash;Corallium Rubrum.</p>
</div>

<p>A good idea of the celebrated red and pink Coral of commerce,
so much admired for its brilliant color, and the high
polish of which it is susceptible, may be gathered from our
next illustration. As in the other species to which we have
referred, the calcareous skeleton is enveloped in a living
gelatinous substance, from which the Zoophytes seem to
shoot out like buds from the bark of a tree. Several of
these animalcules are exhibited in our figure, in the active
enjoyment of life; gathering in, with their expanded tentacles,
the elements of their stony edifice from the surrounding
waters. After death the fleshy integument is wasted
away by the action of the sea; and the framework that
remains behind, washed ashore by the waves, or hooked
up by the coral fisherman, is wrought into brooches, bracelets,
necklaces, and other ornaments of various kinds.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>

<p>Not a few varieties of the Coral-producing Zoophytes are
to be found in actual living reality on our own coasts,
where the curious student may examine for himself their
habits and general structure. But it is in the warmer
regions of the Earth that they are developed in the greatest
numbers, and decked in the brightest hues. Those who have
seen them through the crystal waters of tropical seas, swarming
in countless multitudes on the clear white sand below,
speak with enthusiasm of their luxuriant profusion and of
their striking beauty. Combining to a picturesque elegance
of form a rich variety and pleasing harmony of colors, they
present to the eye a scene which has been compared to a
magnificent garden, laid out in diverse beds of rare and
splendid flowers.</p>

<p>So far we have spoken only of the Polypidom, that is to
say, the community of Polyps living together on a common
stem of their own construction. Now this Polypidom is
the first element of the Coral Reef. In some species of
Zoophytes, the Red Coral for instance, the calcareous stem
never attains a size greater than that of a diminutive shrub.
But in others, and they are very numerous, especially in
tropical seas, there seems to be no limit to the growth of
the solid stony framework. As the existing generation of
Zoophytes is dying out, new individuals are ever budding
forth, which continue unceasingly to secrete carbonate of
lime, as their predecessors had done before them, from the
waters of the ocean; and thus the tree-like form spreads
its branching arms on every side, growing upward and
outward day by day. The soft gelatinous parts of those
generations that have passed away are, in a short time, dissolved,
and the stony skeleton alone remains behind.
Ages roll on: the calcareous framework, ever increasing
in size, becomes at length a formidable rock; and this rock
is the Coral Reef.</p>

<p>Let it not be supposed we are here advancing a theory:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
we are only stating a fact that has been established by close
and repeated observations. All the phenomena exhibited
in the development of the Polypidom, are exhibited no less
plainly in every Coral Reef that has yet been examined.
On the surface of the Reef are the living Zoophytes, clinging
to the calcareous skeleton which is ever growing larger
through the unconscious action of their vital functions;
while immediately beneath may be seen the same stony
skeleton, already divested of its fleshy integument, and
beginning to assume the appearance of compact and massive
rock. We can behold, therefore, the mason at work
on the upper story of his building, and the structure
already finished below. And so we have little less than
ocular demonstration that the Coral Reef is the work of the
Zoophyte.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed, however, that in every part of
the Coral Reef, the form and outline of the stony skeleton
are exactly preserved. Fragments of the rock are broken
off by the force of the waves, and mixed up with the comminuted
shells of oysters, mussels, and other crustaceous
animals inhabiting the same waters. In this way a sort of
calcareous gravel, sometimes a calcareous paste, is formed,
which fills up the interstices, and connects the tree-like
coral into a compact rock.</p>

<p>We have yet to explain how the Coral Reefs come, in
many cases, to rise above the surface of the ocean, and to
form dry land: for it has been found that the reef-building
Zoophytes require to be continually immersed in salt water,
and therefore, by their own efforts, they cannot raise their
structure above the ordinary level of the sea. This question
was for a long time involved in obscurity; but it has been
cleared up by the actual observations of Naturalists in
modern times. The following description, which is given
to us by Chamisso, the companion of Kotzebue on his
voyages, will convey a good idea of the process by which a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
sunken reef is often converted into a smiling, fruitful
island. “When the reef is of such a height that it remains
almost dry at low water, the corals leave off building.
Above this line a continuous mass of solid stone is seen,
composed of the shells of mollusks and echini, with their
broken-off prickles and fragments of coral, united by calcareous
sand, produced by the pulverization of shells.
The heat of the sun often penetrates the mass of stone
when it is dry, so that it splits in many places, and the force
of the waves is thereby enabled to separate and lift blocks
of coral, frequently six feet long and three or four in
thickness, and throw them upon the reef, by which means
the ridge becomes at length so high that it is covered only
during some seasons of the year by spring tides. After
this the calcareous sand lies undisturbed, and offers to the
seeds of trees and plants cast upon it by the waves, a soil
upon which they rapidly grow, to overshadow its dazzling
white surface. Entire trunks of trees, which are carried
by the rivers from other countries and islands, find here at
length a resting place after their long wanderings: with
these come some small animals, such as insects and lizards,
as the first inhabitants. Even before the trees form a wood,
the sea-birds nestle here; stray land-birds take refuge in
the bushes; and, at a much later period, when the work
has been long since completed, man appears and builds
his hut on the fruitful soil.”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p>Another question that seems to call for some explanation
is suggested by the well-known habits of the Zoophytes
themselves. From the observations of Kotzebue and Darwin
it appears that those species which are most effective in
the construction of Reefs cannot flourish at a greater depth
than twenty or thirty fathoms; whereas the coral rocks rise
up in many cases from the bottom of an unfathomable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
ocean. How, then, it may be asked, have the foundations
of these wonderful structures been laid? This question
opens a wide field for philosophical speculation; and we
freely admit that no theory of Coral Reefs can be regarded
as complete and satisfactory, which does not furnish a
reasonable answer. But so far as the purpose of our
argument is concerned, it is quite sufficient if a stratum
of solid limestone, twenty fathoms thick, has been formed
mainly through the agency of these minute animalcules.
And this conclusion, so abundantly demonstrated by facts,
is left quite untouched by the difficulty to which we now
refer.</p>

<p>It will be interesting, however, to notice in passing the
explanation of this phenomenon first suggested by Mr.
Darwin, and now very generally accepted. He maintains
that the whole Coral Reef&mdash;foundations and superstructure
alike&mdash;is, in most cases, the result entirely of organic
agency. The reef-building Zoophyte always begins his
labors in water that is comparatively shallow. But as he is
building upward, it often happens that the bed of the sea
is sinking downward in pretty nearly the same proportion;
and thus the reef is ever increasing in height from its original
base, while the living mass of Zoophytes on its upper
surface remains in about the same depth of water as when
the building first began.</p>

<p>This theory is supported by a vast amount of curious
and ingenious reasoning. In the first place, there is
nothing more remarkable in the physical conformation of
the Globe, than the immense predominance of water over
land throughout those extensive tracts of ocean where
Coral Reefs abound. Now this is just what we should
naturally expect if the hypothesis of Mr. Darwin were
admitted; for wherever the Crust of the Earth has been
subsiding for many ages on a large scale, the domain of the
sea must of necessity have been considerably enlarged, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
that of the land contracted in proportion. Again, this
hypothesis will be found to harmonize most perfectly with
all the phenomena of Fringing Reefs, Barrier Reefs, Encircling
Reefs, and Lagoon Islands. The Fringing Reef
represents, as it were, the first stage of progress. The
building operations have just commenced near the shore
of some island or continent, and but little space intervenes
between the land and the incrusting wall of coral. Then,
as the Crust of the Earth gradually subsides, the water encroaches
on the land, and forms a channel between it and
the reef. Meanwhile the Zoophytes are at work, and the
coral rock is growing upward as the foundation on which
it rests is sinking downward: each year it is higher from
the bed of the sea, and yet no nearer to the surface of the
waters. And when at length the channel, which is ever
growing wider and wider, has reached a certain limit, the
Fringing Reef becomes a Barrier Reef, or if it encompasses
an island, an Encircling Reef. Lastly, the Encircling
Reef will finally become a Lagoon Island, when the highest
peaks of the land it encloses have slowly disappeared
beneath the surface of the waters.</p>

<p>In confirmation of this reasoning Mr. Darwin has pointed
out numerous examples to illustrate each intermediate stage
through which, according to his hypothesis, the Coral Reef
must pass in the progress of its construction. He traces
the gradual transition from the low bank of coral incrusting
a rocky shore to the Encircling Reef that compasses round
a lofty island, like Tahiti, with a broad channel between.
Then he shows how this channel insensibly becomes wider
and wider, encroaching more and more upon the land,
until at length only a few high peaks remain above water.
Finally he leads us on to the case of a perfect Atoll, within
which no trace of land remains to be seen; and the channel,
now become a lagoon, is encompassed by a Reef of
Coral Rock that rises steeply from an unfathomed ocean.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span></p>

<p>We do not mean to dwell upon this ingenious speculation,
which would carry us too far from the object at which
we are aiming. It seems to us, however, that the arguments
in its favor are at least deserving of careful consideration;
and we may add that they receive new strength from
the facts we shall have occasion hereafter to bring forward,
when we come to speak of the undulating movements to
which the Crust of the Earth has been subject at many
different times, and in many different localities, even within
the historic period.</p>

<p>The formation and structure of existing Coral Reefs being
once fairly established, Geologists have little difficulty
in ascribing a similar origin to many of the limestone
strata that are found in the Crust of the Earth. For though
the internal texture has been considerably modified in the
long course of ages, by chemical and other influences,
nevertheless the stony skeletons of the reef-building Zoophytes
can be distinctly recognized in great abundance.
Indeed it is not an uncommon thing to meet with limestone
rock exhibiting plainly to the eye all the appearance
of Coral Reefs lifted up from the bed of the ocean. “The
Oolite,” says Doctor Mantell, “abounds in corals, and
contains beds of limestone which are merely coral reefs
that have undergone no change but that of elevation from
the bottom of the deep, and the consolidation of their
materials. The Coral-rag of Wilts presents in fact all the
characters of modern reefs: the polypifera belong chiefly
to the Astr&aelig;id&aelig;, the genera of which family principally
contribute to the formations now going on in the Pacific.
Shells, echinoderms, teeth, and bones of fishes, and other
marine exuvi&aelig;, occupy the interstices between the corals,
and the whole is consolidated by sand and gravel, held
together in some instances by calcareous, in others by siliceous
infiltrations. Those who have visited districts where
the Coral-rag forms the immediate subsoil, and is exposed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
to view in the quarries or in natural sections, must have
been struck with the resemblance of these rocks to modern
coral banks.”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<p>Even in many of our finest marbles the coral skeletons
may be traced distinctly enough, and contribute not a little
to that variegated color which is so much admired. Nay,
it is recorded by Mr. Parkinson that he discovered in a piece
of solid marble, the <i>animal membrane itself</i> by which the
lime was originally abstracted from the sea. He immersed
the marble in dilute muriatic acid; and he relates with delight
how, as the calcareous earth dissolved, and the carbonic
acid gas escaped, he observed the animal tissue
begin distinctly to appear in the form of light, elastic membranes.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">As</span> animals, by organic action, extract lime from the
waters of the ocean they inhabit, which, being
converted in the first instance into minute shells,
or stony skeletons, afterward passes into a compact and
solid rock, so in like manner do plants and trees extract
carbon from the atmosphere in which they vegetate, and
convert it into coal. No reasonable doubt can now be
entertained that coal derives its existence, almost entirely,
from the woody tissue of sunken swamps and forests.
Though the nature of the process by which this transformation
takes place, is yet but imperfectly understood, and is,
indeed, at the present moment a subject of much discussion
and controversy, nevertheless the <i>fact</i> that the change <i>has</i>
taken place is fully accepted by all as an established truth,
and is supported by an accumulation of evidence which it
is not easy to resist.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span></p>

<p>The first circumstance to which we shall call attention,
is the wonderful profusion of vegetable life that is always
associated with coal. Every one who has descended at
any time into a coal mine, or who has examined the specimens
usually exhibited in a well-furnished museum, must
have been struck by the countless forms of trees and plants,
which still remain vividly impressed on this black and unsightly
mineral. Dr. Buckland has described this phenomenon
with much vigor and beauty in his celebrated
Bridgewater Treatise: “The finest example I have ever
witnessed is that of the coal mines of Bohemia just mentioned.
The most elaborate imitations of living foliage
upon the painted ceilings of Italian palaces, bear no comparison
with the beauteous profusion of extinct vegetable
forms with which the galleries of these instructive coal
mines are overhung. The roof is covered as with a canopy
of gorgeous tapestry, enriched with festoons of most
graceful foliage, flung in wild irregular profusion over
every portion of its surface. The effect is heightened by
the contrast of the coal-black color of these vegetables
with the light ground-work of the rock to which they are
attached. The spectator feels himself transported, as if
by enchantment, into the forests of another world; he beholds
trees of forms and characters now unknown upon
the surface of the earth, presented to his senses almost in
the beauty and vigor of their primeval life; their scaly stems
and bending branches, with their delicate apparatus of
foliage, are all spread forth before him, little impaired by
the lapse of countless ages, and bearing faithful records of
extinct systems of vegetation, which began and terminated
in times of which these relics are the infallible historians.”</p>

<p class="table">Fossil Ferns found in the Coal Measures of Europe and America.</p>

<p>The next important fact that points to the vegetable
origin of Coal is, that wood and Coal are both composed
of the same ultimate elements&mdash;carbon, hydrogen, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
oxygen. This analogy is the more remarkable when we
are told that no other rock except Coal exhibits anything
approaching to this composition. It is true that the elements
just enumerated do not exist in the same proportions
in wood and in Coal. But the difference, when rightly
understood, rather tends to confirm our theory that the one
is derived from the other. There is more Carbon in Coal
than in wood; while there is less oxygen and less hydrogen.
To explain how this may have come to pass during the
process of transition, we must call in the assistance of the
chemist. It appears from the researches of Liebig that,
when vegetable matter is buried in the earth, exposed to
moisture, and partially or entirely excluded from the air,
the process of decomposition sets in, and that under this
process carbonic acid gas and carburetted hydrogen gas are
slowly evolved. At the same time a portion of the oxygen
when set free would naturally enter into a new combination
with a portion of the hydrogen, and form water. The
result of these several changes would necessarily be, that
the accumulation of vegetable matter buried in the earth
would part, in course of time, with no small share of its
carbon, its hydrogen, and its oxygen, but not with all in
the same proportions: for the new combinations would
use up more of the oxygen than of the hydrogen, and
more of the hydrogen than of the carbon.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> In other
words, if the process should have gone on for a sufficient
lapse of ages, these elements would no longer exist together
in the proportions which are necessary to constitute
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
wood, but would rather exist in the proportions which are
found to constitute coal.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

<p>This explanation is confirmed by a fact with which our
readers are no doubt familiar. According to the explanation,
carbonic acid and carburetted hydrogen are evolved
during the process by which coal is produced from wood.
We should therefore expect to find these gases closely associated
with Coal. If they are <i>not</i> so associated, their absence
is a serious objection against our theory; but if they
<i>are</i> so associated, their presence is a strong evidence in its
favor. Now on this point, as every one knows, practical
miners bear testimony that the fact corresponds exactly with
our theory. They tell us that reservoirs of Choke-damp,
which is carbonic acid, and of Fire-damp, which is carburetted
hydrogen, are found very commonly pent up in
the crevices and cavities of coal beds, and are the cause,
when tapped, of many of the accidents which take place.
They even assure us that some beds of coal are so saturated
with gas that, when cut into, it may be heard oozing from
every pore of the rock, and the coal is called <i>singing coal</i>
by the colliers.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>To sum up, then, what we have said on this point: it
appears, first, that the same constituent elements are found
in wood and Coal; secondly, though they do not exist in
the same proportions in the two substances, the difference
is fully accounted for by the changes which we should
naturally expect to take place when large accumulations of
vegetable matter are buried in the earth; thirdly, in the
hypothesis of these changes, carbonic acid and carburetted
hydrogen would certainly be developed; and in point of
fact, these gases are found intimately associated with Coal
all over the world.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

<p>There is another remarkable fact which fits in most admirably
with our theory. Coal is found at the present day
in the Crust of the Earth, disposed in thin seams or beds,
and each bed is almost uniformly found to rest upon a
stratum of fine clay, sometimes several feet in thickness.
This is just what our theory would lead us to expect. If
coal is produced from plants and trees, these plants and
trees must have grown upon some suitable soil; and, therefore,
in this hypothesis we should expect, ordinarily speaking
at least, to find a bed of clay beneath every bed of coal.
But this is not all. When we examine more closely the
stratum on which the coal reposes, we find the roots and
stems of trees mingled with the clay in the greatest profusion.
In the Welsh coal field, in a depth of twelve thousand
feet, there are from fifty to a hundred beds of coal, each
lying on a stratum of clay abounding in these remains.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<p>We now come to an argument of a practical kind which
appeals to common sense and common experience. Let us
suppose that a person wholly unacquainted with the art of
manufacturing paper, were to enter a paper-mill when the
workmen are away, and the process of manufacture for a
time suspended. At first sight he would probably find it
difficult to persuade himself, that the piles of clean white
paper, which attract his notice at one end of the building,
are produced from the heaps of filthy rags which he sees
accumulated at the other. But if he be a sagacious observer,
he will soon find evidence to convince him that this is
really the case. For he will perceive, upon close examination,
that the self-same material is exhibited in every intermediate
state of progress from one extreme to the other.
First, there is the great chest with its numerous compartments,
in which the rags are seen carefully sorted, according
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
to their various degrees of quality and texture. Next
comes the fulling-mill, where they are washed and bleached.
Then the revolving cylinder, furnished on the exterior surface
with sharp blades or cutters; and the vat in which it
moves is filled with the rags, which now assume the form
of a thin liquid pulp. Advancing still further he will see
this pulp evenly spread out upon a wire-gauze frame, and
now at last it is beginning to exhibit some likeness to the
form and substance of paper. Further on it is seen pressed
and dried; and last of all cut into sheets and laid aside in
lofty piles.</p>

<p>Now it seems to us that we are placed in somewhat of
the same position, as regards the manufacture of Coal.
We cannot observe the process actually going on; for
though, in this process, the work is never suspended, the
workmen never at rest, yet extending as it does over a space
of many centuries, it is too slow to be sensible; and besides
it is conducted in great part beneath the surface of
the Earth. Nevertheless, we can trace the progress of
change through each intermediate stage of the transition,
from one extreme to the other,&mdash;from the primeval swamps
and forests through the numerous varieties of the Peat and
Lignite to the richest beds of pure Coal.</p>

<p>First, then, we have the great forest-covered swamps,
like those which now occupy the valley and delta of the
Mississippi. They are composed in many cases of pure
vegetable matter without any intermixture of earthy sediment.
A dense growth of reeds, and shrubs, and herbage of
every kind, covers the whole surface of the land, mixed up
with the decaying leaves and prostrate trunks of forest-trees.
Sir Charles Lyell mentions a very remarkable fact observed
in the swamps of Louisiana. During an unusually hot
season, when any part of a swamp is dried up, if the surface
be set on fire, a pit is burned into the ground many
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
feet deep, in fact, as far down as the fire can descend
without meeting water; and it is then found that scarcely
any residuum or earthy matter is left.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p>Vegetable strata of this kind are produced, not only upon
dry land by the growth and decay of forests, but also beneath
the waters of lakes and estuaries, by the accumulation
of Drift-timber borne along in the current of swollen
rivers. The Mackenzie River, which drains a great part
of Northwestern America, affords many admirable illustrations.
Flowing as it does from south to north, it is subject
to annual inundations when the snows begin to melt
in the higher parts of its course, while the channel lower
down, situated in colder latitudes, is still blocked up with
ice. At this season then it overflows its banks, and sweeping
through vast forests, carries away thousands of uprooted
trees in its impetuous torrent.</p>

<p>“As the trees,” says Dr. Richardson, “retain their
roots, which are often loaded with earth and stones, they
readily sink, especially when water-soaked; and accumulating
in the eddies, form shoals, which ultimately augment
into islands. A thicket of small willows covers the
new-formed island as soon as it appears above water, and
their fibrous roots serve to bind the whole firmly together.
Sections of these islands are annually made by the river;
and it is interesting to study the diversities of appearances
they present according to their different ages. The trunks
of the trees gradually decay until they are converted into a
blackish-brown substance resembling peat, but still retaining
more or less of the fibrous structure of the wood; and
layers of this often alternate with layers of clay and sand,
the whole being penetrated, to a depth of four or five yards
or more, by the long fibrous roots of the willows. A deposition
of this kind, with the aid of a little infiltration of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
bituminous matter, would produce an excellent imitation
of Coal, with vegetable impressions of the willow roots.</p>

<p>“It was in the rivers only that we could observe sections
of these deposits; but the same operation goes on, on a
much more magnificent scale, in the lakes. A shoal of
many miles in extent is formed on the south side of Athabasca
Lake by the Drift-timber and vegetable d&eacute;bris brought
down by the Elk River; and the Slave Lake itself must in
process of time be filled up by the matters daily conveyed
into it from Slave River. Vast quantities of Drift-timber are
buried under the sand at the mouth of the river, and enormous
piles of it are accumulated on the shores of every
part of the lake.”</p>

<p>Not unfrequently it happens that these strata of vegetable
matter, with the roots and trunks of trees, their branches,
fruits, and leaves, more or less perfectly preserved, are
covered over by subsequent deposits. Such accumulations,
we are assured by Doctor Mantell, have been found
deep in the soil on the coast of England, in places that are
still subject to periodical inundations. “The trees are
chiefly of the oak, hazel, fir, birch, yew, willow, and ash;
in short, almost every kind that is indigenous to this island
occasionally occurs. The trunks and branches are dyed
throughout of a deep ebony color by iron; and the wood
is firm and heavy, and occasionally fit for domestic use; in
Yorkshire and elsewhere, timber of this kind is sometimes
employed in the construction of houses.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> Here, then,
is the first stage of the conversion of wood into Coal,&mdash;a
stratum more or less compacted together of vegetable matter,
spread out sometimes over the surface of the dry land,
sometimes on the floor of lakes and estuaries, and often
buried beneath an accumulation of subsequent deposits.</p>

<p>The next stage in the process of transformation may be
represented by those Peat Bogs which constitute one of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
most remarkable physical characteristics of Ireland, covering
as they do an area equal to one-tenth of the whole
island. In these the vegetable matter is more closely condensed,
but the structure of the plants from which the Peat
is derived is still preserved, and may be distinctly recognized
by the naked eye. Nay, we have still the prostrate
trunks of trees lying around on every side as they fell to
the ground in their ancient forests. The researches recently
pursued upon this subject have brought to light a fact which
is very much to our present purpose; for it seems to prove
our thesis by direct evidence. “In Limerick, in the district
of Maine, one of the States of North America, there
are Peat Bogs of considerable extent, in which a substance
exactly similar to <i>cannel coal</i> is found at the depth of three
or four feet from the surface amidst the remains of rotten
logs of wood and <i>beaver sticks</i>: the peat is twenty feet thick,
and rests upon white sand. This coal was discovered on
digging a ditch to drain a portion of the bog, for the purpose
of obtaining peat for manure. The substance is a
true bituminous coal, containing more bitumen than is
found in any other variety. Polished sections of the compact
masses exhibit the peculiar structure of coniferous
trees, and prove that the coal was derived from a species
allied to the American Fir.”<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> A similar phenomenon was
observed by Doctor Dieffenbach in the Chathain Islands.
In the same bed of peat he was able distinctly to trace a
gradual transition from pure vegetable matter to a mineral
substantially identical with common coal.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></p>

<p>But though Peat may thus, as it should seem, pass directly
into pure Coal, there are many cases in which it first
assumes a more imperfect form, known under the name of
Lignite. This substance is described as of a brownish
color, “soft and mellow in consistence when freshly
quarried, but becoming brittle by exposure, the fracture
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
following the direction of the fibre of the wood.”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> It
clearly occupies an intermediate position between Peat and
Coal. Like the former, it still exhibits the stems and
woody fibre of the plants from which it is derived, very
little altered in their structure; while on the other hand it
is already beginning to acquire some of the consistency and
density of Coal; to which also it approaches much more
closely in its chemical composition. It should be remembered,
moreover, that Lignite does not designate a substance
of a fixed, invariable character. On the contrary,
under the one general name are comprised a definite number
of varieties, leading from one extreme to the other by a
series of almost insensible gradations; the extreme variety
on one side being scarcely distinguishable from Peat, while
the extreme variety on the other is practically identical
with ordinary Coal. It can hardly be doubted, therefore, that
Coal must have the same origin as Lignite, while it is at
least equally certain that Lignite has been derived from
Peat; and we have already seen what overwhelming evidence
may be adduced to show that the origin of Peat is to
be sought for in the sunken swamps and forests of a long
past age.</p>

<p>Lastly, when we come to examine the texture of Coal
itself, we find much to confirm the conclusion at which we
have thus arrived. In beds of pure Coal the remains of
many species of plants have been detected, and sometimes
in such abundance as to constitute visibly the bulk of the
Coal. Even large trees are sometimes found standing
erect in the Coal fields, with their bark actually converted
into this mineral. The annexed Figure represents a portion
of the stem, together with the roots of a tall forest tree,
Sigillaria, discovered not long ago in a Coal mine at Saint
Helens, near Liverpool. The stem, which was nine feet
high, was found erect in the seam of Coal, while the roots,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
ten in number, stretched away into the vegetable soil beneath.</p>

</div>

<p>Not less than thirty such trees, some of them four or five
feet in diameter, and all incrusted with Coal, were laid bare
a short time since, in a Colliery near Newcastle, within an
area of fifty yards square. “In 1830,” writes Sir Charles
Lyell, “a slanting trunk was exposed in Craigleith quarry,
near Edinburgh, the total length of which exceeded sixty
feet. Its diameter at the top was about seven inches, and
near the base, it measured five feet in its greater, and two
feet in its lesser, width. The bark was converted into a thin
coating of the purest and finest Coal.” Again, “in South
Staffordshire, a seam of Coal was laid bare in the year 1844,
in what is called an open work at Parkfield Colliery, near
Wolverhampton. In the space of about a quarter of an
acre, the stumps of no less than seventy-three trees, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
their roots attached, appeared, some of them more than
eight feet in circumference. The trunks, broken off close
to the root, were lying prostrate in every direction, often
crossing each other. One of them measured fifteen, another
thirty feet in length, and others less. They were
invariably flattened to the thickness of one or two inches,
and converted into Coal. Their roots formed part of a
stratum of Coal ten inches thick, which rested on a layer
of clay two inches thick, below which was a second forest
resting on a two-foot seam of Coal. Five feet below this
again was a third forest, with large stumps of Lepidodendra,
Calamites, and other trees.”<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have now brought to a close a very important line
of argument in the Science of Geology. We have pointed
out that, in the strata which compose the Crust of the Earth,
there are rocks of various kinds, distinguished from one
another as well by the nature of the materials which compose
them, as by the manner in which these materials are
arranged together; and we have shown that rocks presenting
the same general appearances, and composed of exactly
the same materials, are being produced in the present
age upon the Surface of the Earth, through the agency of
natural causes. Moreover, we have closely examined, in
certain cases, the nature of the process by which the formation
of these rocks is accomplished at the present day; and
we have seen how difficult it is, when the facts of the case
are once clearly before us, to resist the conclusion that the
rocks which we now find buried in the Earth, were produced
in some former age, by the same causes which are
still at work. We shall next proceed to inquire how far
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
this conclusion is confirmed by the independent evidence
of Fossil Remains.</p>

<p>But before entering on a new line of argument, it is fit we
should take notice of an objection which has sometimes
been urged against the reasoning we have hitherto pursued,
and which has done much to create and to keep
alive a prejudice unfavorable to the Science of Geology.
Religious writers have not unfrequently insinuated, and
sometimes have plainly asserted, that, in ascribing the present
structure of the Earth’s Crust to the operation of natural
causes, Geologists would seem to make no account of
God’s Omnipotence. A moment’s reflection will convince
the reader that this charge is utterly unphilosophical. Is it
not plain that the more fully we appreciate and acknowledge
the wonderful works of Nature, the more deeply must
we become impressed with the power and wisdom of Him
who is the Author and Ruler of Nature? To say that
secondary causes exist, and to point out the monuments that
bear witness to their operation in long passed ages, is not to
deny, but rather to affirm the existence of a Great First
Cause, upon whom they all depend for their existence,
their preservation, and their guidance.</p>

<p>We are everywhere reminded by abundant evidence, that
it has pleased the Great Creator to employ the agency of
His creatures in the fashioning and the adorning of this
material universe. He does not create at once, as He well
might do, the great oak of the forest; but He allows the
seed to sink into the earth, where it is watered by the gentle
dews of Heaven, and fructified by the genial warmth of the
sun; soon it puts forth a tender germ; the germ, in time,
imbibing the elements of its support from the air and the
earth, becomes a sappling, and the sappling a tree, which
spreads its huge branches on every side, and serves for
many purposes of ornament and of use. Or let us take the
case of the honeycomb, that most curious and ingenious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
work, at once the palace and the storehouse of a vast and
busy community. It is not produced in a moment by a
simple act of creation. God has not made it Himself,
but He has taught the bee to make it. In like manner He
has provided for the little birds, not by building their nests,
but by infusing into their nature that mysterious instinct
which prompts them to build, and guides them in their
work.</p>

<p>Geologists, therefore, when they undertake to explain the
existence of Stratified Rocks, not by the immediate action
of the Creator, but by the intervention of natural causes,
are not on that account to be accused of impiety. They
do not disparage, but rather magnify His glory, when they
expatiate upon the endless variety of agents which, according
to their theory, He has employed in the structure of the
material world. If the honeycomb, as a work of contrivance
and design, excites the wonder and admiration of the
philosopher, what must we think of the contrivance and
design exhibited by Him who has made, not the honeycomb
only, but the bee that builds the honeycomb? And
so, too, we get novel and unexpected views of God’s
Omnipotence, when, through the science of Geology, we
come to understand the vast and harmonious series of
secondary causes by which he has brought the Crust of the
Earth into its present form and shape. The impress of His
hand is stamped upon His works; and all that is wonderful
and attractive in Nature is but the token of His power and
the shadow of His beauty. And so our national poet has
sung:</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Reader</span>, you are beginning to suspect us. ‘How
long do we propose to detain people?’ For anything
that appears we may be designing to write
on to the twentieth century. ‘And <i>whither</i> are we going?’
Toward what object? which is as urgent a qu&aelig;re as, <i>how
far</i>? Perhaps we may be leading you into treason. You
feel symptoms of doubt and restiveness; and like Hamlet
with his father’s ghost, “you will follow us no further unless
we explain what it is that we are in quest of.”</p>

<p>These words of Thomas De Quincey to his readers, in
the middle of one of his discursive essays, which, interesting
as they certainly are in all their parts, yet sometimes
beget a feeling of weariness from the uncomfortable apprehension
that they will not come to an end, are, perhaps,
scarcely less appropriate in our own case. It may be that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
our readers have been left too long in the uneasy state of
suspense and hope deferred. They came to our pages to
look for a practical solution of the question, Is Geology at
variance with the Bible? And what avails it, they may ask,
to discourse to them of the Gulf Stream, and Rivers, and
Glaciers, and Alluvial Plains, and Coral Rocks, and Coal
Mines? With painful steps they have been toiling after us
through tedious disquisitions, straining their eyes to see the
end, but the end is not yet in sight. Well, then, if they
will rest for a few minutes by the way, we will pause, too,
and tell them what we are about, and try to bring out more
clearly the object at which we are aiming.</p>

<p>Our design from the beginning was to consider the
points of contact between Geology and Revelation; to examine
the relations that exist between these two departments
of knowledge,&mdash;one resting upon reason and observation,
the other given to us from Heaven; and to inquire
how far it may be possible to adopt the conclusions of the
former, while we adhere, at the same time, with unswerving
fidelity, to the unchangeable truths of the latter. With
this end in view, we proceeded at once to sketch out the more
prominent features of Geological theory; not the particular
theory of one writer, or of one school, but that more general
theory which is adopted by all writers, and prevails in
every school. This theory, we were all well aware, is in
many points widely at variance with the common notions
of sensible and even well-informed men who have not
devoted much attention to the study of Physical Science.
And it occurred to us that, possibly, many of our readers
might be disposed to cut the controversy short by rejecting,
in a summary way, the whole system of Geology, and treating
it as an empty shadow or an idle dream. This, we
were convinced, would be a mistaken and mischievous
course. Geology is not a house of cards that it may be
blown down by a breath. It is a hypothesis, a theory, if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
you will; but no one can in fairness deny that behind this
theory there are facts,&mdash;unexpected, startling, significant
facts; that these facts, when considered in their relation to
one another, when illustrated by the present phenomena of
Nature, and skilfully grouped together, as they have been
by able men, disclose certain general truths, and suggest
certain arguments, which do seem to point in the direction
of those conclusions at which Geologists have arrived.</p>

<p>It follows that he who would investigate fairly the claims
of Geology, must first learn to appreciate the significance
of these facts, and to estimate the value of these arguments.
And this is precisely what we have been trying to do. We
are not writing a treatise on Geology. Certainly not: it
would be presumptuous in us, with our scanty knowledge,
to attempt it. Besides, Geology has it own professors, and
its lecture-halls, and its manuals. Neither do we mean to
assume the character of the advocates or champions of
Geology. It does not ask our services; in its cause are
enrolled no small proportion of the most illustrious names
which for the last fifty years have adorned the annals of
Physical Science. Nor do we want even to enforce upon
our readers that more general theory of Geology which we
are endeavoring to explain and illustrate. Our purpose is
merely to collect from various sources, and to string together,
the evidence that may be adduced in its favor; that
so, when we come hereafter to consider this theory in its
relation with the History of the Bible, we may not incur the
risk of discomfiture by denying that which has been proved
by facts, but rather approach the subject with such knowledge
as may help us to discover the real harmony that we know
to exist between the truths inscribed on the works of God,
and those which are recorded in His Written Word.</p>

<p>In the accomplishment of this task we have devoted ourselves
chiefly to the study of the Aqueous or Stratified
Rocks. According to Geologists, these rocks, such as we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
find them now, were not the immediate work of creation,
but were slowly produced in the long lapse of ages, and
laid out one above another, by a vast and complex machinery
of secondary causes. The elements of which they
are composed were gathered together from many and various
sources; from the ocean, from the air, from other pre-existing
rocks; and, for aught we know, may have had a
long and eventful history before they came to assume their
present structure and arrangement. Thus, for example,
the Conglomerates, and Sandstones, with which we are so
familiar, are made up of broken fragments derived from
earlier rocks, and then transported to distant sites by the
mountain torrents, or the stately rivers of vast continents,
or the silent currents of the sea; the Limestone with which
we build our houses is the work of living animals that once
swarmed in countless myriads beneath the waters of the
ocean; and the Coal which supplies the motive power to
our manufactories, our railways, our ships of war and commerce,
is but the modern representative of ancient swamps
and forests, which, having been buried in the earth, and
there, by the action of chemical laws, endowed with new
properties, were laid by for the future use of man in the
great storehouse of Nature.</p>

<p>This mode of accounting for the origin and formation of
Stratified Rocks constitutes in a manner the framework
that supports and binds together the whole system of Geology.
If it be once fairly established, Geology is entitled to
take high rank as a Physical Science. If on the contrary it
should prove to be without foundation, then Geology is no
longer a science, but a dream. Moreover, it is this theory
of stratification which, from the first, has brought Geology
into contact with Revelation. For Geologists have been
led to infer the extreme Antiquity of the Earth, from the
immense thickness of the Stratified Rocks on the one hand,
and, on the other, the very slow and gradual process by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
which each stratum in the series has been, in its turn, spread
out and consolidated. Those likewise who claim for the
Human Race a greater Antiquity than the Bible allows,
seek for their proofs in the supposed origin and antiquity
of those superficial deposits, in which the remains of Man
or of his works are sometimes found entombed.</p>

<p>It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that the theory of
Stratified Rocks should engage the largest share of our
attention when we undertake to discuss the relation in
which Geology stands to Revealed Religion. For the
present we say nothing about the conclusions that flow from
this theory, or the errors to which it has led when hastily or
ignorantly applied: we are only investigating the evidence
by which it is supported. In our former chapters we have
drawn out at some length the line of reasoning which is
derived from the character of the Aqueous Rocks themselves
when considered in the light of Nature’s present
operations. We have shown that Stratified Rocks of many
different kinds, just such as those which compose the Crust
of the Earth, have been produced by natural causes within
historic times; and we have explained some of the more
simple and intelligible parts of that complex machinery,
which, even now, is busily at work gathering, sorting, distributing,
piling up together, and consolidating the materials
of new strata all over the world. These considerations,
as we took occasion to point out, beget a strong presumption
in favor of Geological theory. Here we have Nature
at work, actually bringing into existence a stratum of rock
before our eyes. And there, in the Crust of the Earth, we
find another stratum of precisely the same kind already finished.
What can be more reasonable than to ascribe the one
to the action of the same causes which we see at work upon
the other? And thus, by extending the area of our observations
from one class of Aqueous Rocks to another, the
idea gradually grows upon us that these rocks have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
spread out, stratum upon stratum, during many successive
ages, by the agency of secondary causes similar to those
which are still in operation; and that each stratum, in its
turn, as it first came into existence, was for a time the
uppermost of the series.</p>

<p>In support of this conclusion we are now about to bring
forward a new and independent argument founded on the
testimony of Fossil Remains. An eminent writer has
summed up in a few words the value and importance of
Fossil Remains in reference to Geological theory. “At
present,” he says, “shells, fishes, and other animals are
buried in the mud or silt of lakes and estuaries; rivers
also carry down the carcases of land animals, the trunks
of trees, and other vegetable drift; and earthquakes submerge
plains and islands, with all their vegetable and
animal inhabitants. These remains become enveloped in
the layers of mud and sand and gravel formed by the
waters, and in process of time are petrified, that is, are
converted into stony matter like the shells and bones found
in the oldest strata. Now, as at present, so in all former
time must the remains of plants and animals have been
similarly preserved; and, as one tribe of plant is peculiar
to the dry plain, another to the swampy morass; as one
family belongs to a temperate, another to a tropical region,
so, from the character of the embedded plants, we are
enabled to arrive at some knowledge of the conditions
under which they flourished. In the same manner with
animals: each tribe has its locality assigned it by peculiarities
of food, climate, and the like; each family has its
own peculiar structure for running, flying, swimming,
plant-eating, or flesh-eating, as the case may be; and by
comparing Fossil Remains with existing races, we are
enabled to determine many of the past conditions of the
world with considerable certainty.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span></p>

<p>On this branch of our subject we do not mean to offer
much in the way of argument strictly so called. We shall
content ourselves with a simple statement of facts, and
leave them to produce their own impression. It will be
necessary at the outset to explain some technical matters,
that what we have to say hereafter may be the better understood:
and if in this we are somewhat dry and tiresome,
we will try to make amends by the curious and interesting
story of Nature’s long buried works, which we hope in the
sequel to unfold.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the word <i>Fossil</i> was first introduced into the English
language, it was employed to designate, as the etymology
suggests, whatever is <i>dug out of the earth</i>.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> But it is
now generally used in a much more restricted sense, being
applied only to the remains of plants and animals embedded
in the Crust of the Earth and there preserved by
natural causes. When we speak of remains, we must be
understood to include even those seemingly transient
impressions, such as foot-prints in the sand, which having
been made permanent by accidental circumstances, and
thus engraved, as it were, on the archives of Nature, now
bear witness to the former existence of organic life.</p>

<p>Now in every part of the world where the Stratified
Rocks have been laid open to view, remains of this kind
are found scattered on all sides in the most profuse abundance.
In Europe, in America, in Australia, in the frozen
wastes of Siberia, in the countless islands scattered over
the waters of the Pacific, there is scarcely a single formation,
from the lowest in the series to the highest, that, when it is
fairly explored, does not yield up vast stores of shells, together
with bones and teeth, nay, sometimes whole skeletons
of animals; also fragments of wood, impressions of
leaves, and other organic substances.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span></p>

<div id="fig_12" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_12.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 12.&mdash;Fossil Irish Deer (County Fermanagh). In the Museum of
Trinity College, Dublin. From Haughton’s Manual of Geology</p>
</div>

<p>These Fossil Remains do not always occur in the same
state of preservation. Sometimes we have the bone, or
plant, or shell, in its natural condition; still retaining not
only its own peculiar form and structure, but likewise the
very same organic substance of which it was originally
composed. Examples innumerable may be seen in the
British Museum, or, indeed, in almost any Geological collection:
the fine skeletons of ancient Irish Deer, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
are exhibited in the Museum of Trinity College, Dublin,
and of which all the bones are in excellent preservation,
must be familiar to many of our readers.</p>

<p>It happens, however, more frequently that the organic
substance itself has disappeared, but has left an impression
on the rock, that now bears witness to its former presence.
Thus, for instance, when a shell has been dissolved and
carried away by water percolating the rock, it has very
often left after it, on the hard stone, a mould of its outer
surface and a cast of its inner surface, with a cavity between
corresponding to the thickness of the shell. In such cases
we have the form, the size, and the superficial markings of
the organic body, but we have no part of its original
substance, and no traces of its internal structure. This
form of fossilization, as Sir Charles Lyell has well put
it, “may be easily understood if we examine the mud
recently thrown out from a pond or canal in which there
are shells. If the mud be argillaceous, it acquires consistency
in drying, and on breaking open a portion of it,
we find that each shell has left impressions of its external
form. If we then remove the shell itself, we find within a
solid nucleus of clay, having the form of the interior of
the shell.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> In many cases the space first occupied by the
shell is not left empty when the shell has been removed,
but is filled up with some mineral substance, such as lime
or flint. The mineral thus introduced becomes the exact
counterpart of the organic body which has disappeared;
and has been justly compared to a bronze statue, which exhibits
the exterior form and lineaments, but not the internal
organization nor the substance of the object it represents.</p>

<p>There is a third form more wonderful still, in which
Fossil Remains are not uncommonly found. The original
body has passed away as in the former case, and yet not
only does its <i>outward shape</i> remain, but even its <i>internal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
texture</i> is perfectly preserved in the solid stone which has
taken its place. This kind of change is exhibited most
remarkably in the vegetable kingdom. Fossil trees of
great size have been discovered of which <i>the whole substance
has been changed from wood to stone</i>: yet with such exquisite
skill has the change been effected that the minute cells and
fibres, and the rings of annual growth, may still be clearly
traced; nay, even those delicate spiral vessels which, from
their extreme minuteness, can be discerned only by the aid
of the microscope. Thus the tree remains complete in all
its parts; but it is no longer a tree of wood; it is, so to
speak, a tree of stone.</p>

<p>The mystery of this extraordinary transformation has not
yet been fully cleared up by scientific men; but the general
principle, at least, is sufficiently understood. It is thus
briefly explained by Sir Charles Lyell: “If an organic substance
is exposed in the open air to the action of the sun
and rain, it will in time putrefy, or be dissolved into its
component elements, consisting usually of oxygen, hydrogen,
nitrogen, and carbon. These will readily be absorbed
by the atmosphere or be washed away by rain, so that all
vestiges of the dead animal or plant disappear. But if the
same substances be submerged in water, they decompose
more gradually; and if buried in the earth, still more slowly,
as in the familiar example of wooden piles or other buried
timber. Now, if as fast as each particle is set free by
putrefaction in a fluid or gaseous state, a particle equally
minute of carbonate of lime, flint, or other mineral is at
hand and ready to be precipitated, we may imagine this
inorganic matter to take the place just before left unoccupied
by the organic molecule. In this manner a cast of
the interior of certain vessels may first be taken, and afterward
the more solid walls of the same may decay and
suffer a like transmutation.”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> This exposition, so simple
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
and luminous in itself, may, perhaps, be rendered still more
intelligible to the general reader by an ingenious illustration
of Mr. Jukes. “It is,” he says, “as if a house were
gradually rebuilt, brick by brick, or stone by stone, a brick
or a stone of a different kind having been substituted for
each of the former ones, the shape and size of the house, the
forms and arrangements of its rooms, passages, and closets,
and even the number and shape of the bricks and stones,
remaining unaltered.”<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<p>This singular kind of petrifaction, by which not only
the external form, but even the organic tissue itself, is converted
into stone, has been illustrated, in a very interesting
way, by Professor G&ouml;ppert of Breslau. With a view to imitate
as nearly as he could the process of Nature, “he steeped
a variety of animal and vegetable substances in waters, some
holding siliceous, others calcareous, others metallic matter
in solution. He found that in the period of a few weeks,
or even days, the organic bodies thus immersed were mineralized
to a certain extent. Thus, for example, thin vertical
slices of deal, taken from the Scotch fir, were immersed
in a moderately strong solution of sulphate of iron. When
they had been thoroughly soaked in the liquid for several
days, they were dried and exposed to a red heat until the
vegetable matter was burnt up and nothing remained but
an oxide of iron, which was found to have taken the form of
the deal so exactly that casts even of the dotted vessels peculiar

<p>If we have succeeded in making ourselves understood,
the reader will now have a pretty accurate notion of what
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
is meant, in modern Geology, by Fossil Remains. They
are the remains or impressions of plants and animals, buried
in the earth by natural causes, and preserved to our time in
any one of the three forms we have just described. Either
the body itself remains, still retaining its own natural substance,
together with its external form and its internal structure.
Or secondly, the organic substance and the organic
structure have both disappeared, but the outward form and
the superficial markings have been left impressed on the
solid rock. Or thirdly, the substance of the body has been
converted into stone, but with such a delicate art, that it is
in all respects, outwardly and inwardly, still the same body,
with a new substance. We should observe, however, that
these three different forms of fossilization, which we have
successively described, are not always clearly distinct in
actual fossil specimens, but are often curiously blended
together according as the original organic substance has been
more or less completely displaced, or the process of petrifaction
has been more or less perfectly accomplished.</p>

<p>It will probably have occurred to the intelligent reader that
we have already had some insight into the Fossil world, when
investigating the origin of Organic Rocks. We have seen, for
instance, that Coal is the representative to our age of swamps
and forests which once covered the earth with vegetation;
that Mountain Limestone is in great part formed from the
skeletons of reef-building corals; that the White Chalk of
Europe is almost entirely derived from the remains of
marine shells. But it should be observed that these and
such like rocks, while they afford us much valuable information
about the ancient organic condition of our planet, are
not, strictly speaking, Fossil Remains. For, not only does
the substance of the organic bodies they represent exhibit
an altered character, but the internal structure has been in
great part effaced, and even the outward forms and superficial
markings have disappeared. They contain, it is true,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
great multitudes of Fossils. In the Coal, for example, are
found, as we have seen, trunks of trees, together with the
impressions of plants and leaves: in the Chalk and Mountain
Limestone, fragments of shells and corals are often discovered
in a state of perfect preservation. But the bulk of these
formations is made up not so much of Fossil Remains, as
of that into which Fossil Remains have been converted.
Coal, for instance, is something more than Fossil wood;
Chalk, and Limestone, and Marble, are something more
than Fossil shells and corals.</p>

<p>Fossil Remains properly so called present a very much more
lively picture of the ancient inhabitants of our Globe. But
it is a picture that can but faintly be conveyed to the mind
by the way of mere verbal description. He who would appreciate
aright the reality and the significance of Fossil Remains
must gather his impressions from actual observation.
Let him go, for instance, to the British Museum, and walk
slowly through the long suite of noble galleries which are
there exclusively devoted to this branch of science. He
will feel as if transported into another world, the reality of
which he could scarcely have believed if he had not seen it
with his own eyes. Before him, and behind him, and on each
side of him, as he moves along, are spread out in long
array forms of beasts, and birds, and fish, and amphibious
animals, such as he has never seen before, nor dreamt of in
his wildest dreams. Yet much as he may wonder at these
strange figures, he never for a moment doubts that they
were once indued with life, and moved over the surface of
the earth, or disported in the waters of the deep. Nay
more, though the forms are new to him, he will be at no
loss, however inexperienced in Natural History, to find
many analogies between the creation in the midst of which
he stands, and the creation with which he has been hitherto
familiar. There are quadrupeds, and bipeds, and reptiles.
Some of the animals were manifestly designed to walk on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
dry land, some to swim in the sea, and some to fly in the
air. Some are armed with claws like the lion or the tiger,
others have the paddles of a turtle, and others again have
the fins of a fish. Here is an enormous beast that might
almost pass for an elephant, though an experienced eye will
not fail to detect an important difference; and there is an
amphibious monster that suggests the idea of a crocodile;
and again a little further on is an unsightly creature which
unites the general characteristics of the diminutive sloth
with the colossal proportions of the largest rhinoceros.</p>

<p>If left to mere conjecture, the visitor would perhaps
suppose that these uncouth monsters had been brought together
by some adventurous traveller from the remote regions
of the world. But no: he will find on inquiry that the
vast majority belong to species which for centuries have
not been known to flourish on the Earth; and that many
of the strangest forms before him have been dug up almost
from beneath the very soil on which he stands,&mdash;from the
quarries of Surrey, of Sussex, and of Kent, and from the
deep cuttings on the many lines of railway that diverge from
the great metropolis of London. The life they represent
so vividly is, indeed, widely different from that which flourishes
around us; but it is the life not so much of a far
distant country as of a far distant age.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed, however, that such skeletons as
those which first arrest the eye in the galleries of the British
Museum&mdash;so colossal in their proportions and so complete
in all their details&mdash;fairly exhibit the general character
of Fossil Remains. Perfect skeletons of gigantic animals
are rarely to be found. They are the exception and
not the general rule,&mdash;the magnificent reward of long and
toilsome exploration, or, it may be, the chance discovery
that brings wealth to the humble home of some rustic
laborer. Very different are the common every day discoveries
of the working Geologist. Disjointed bones and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
skulls, scattered teeth, fragments of shells, the eggs of birds,
the impressions of leaves,&mdash;these are the ordinary relics that
Nature has stored up for our instruction in the various
strata of the Earth’s Crust: and these likewise constitute
by far the greater part of the treasures which are gathered
together in our Geological Museums.</p>

<p>We will suppose, then, that the visitor has gratified his
sense of wonder in gazing at the larger and more striking
forms, few in number, that rise up prominently before him,
and seem to stare at him in return from their hollow sockets:
he must next turn his attention to the cases that stand
against the walls, and to the cabinets that stretch along the
galleries in distant perspective. Let him survey that multitude
of bones of every shape and size, and those countless
legions of shells, and then try to realize to his mind what a
profusion and variety of animal life are here represented.
And yet he must remember that this is but a single collection.
There are thousands of others, public and private,
scattered over England, France, Germany, Italy, and beyond
the Atlantic, on the continent of America, and even
in Australia; all of which have been furnished from a few
isolated spots,&mdash;scarcely more than specks on the surface
of the Globe,&mdash;where the interior of the Earth’s Crust has
chanced to be laid open to the explorations of the Geologist.</p>

<p>Lastly, before he leaves this splendid gallery, let him take
a passing glance at the Organic Remains of the vegetable
world. There is no mistaking the forms here presented to
his view. He will recognize at once the massive and lofty
trunks of forest trees with their spreading branches; the
tender foliage of the lesser plants; and, in particular, the
graceful fern, which cannot fail to attract his eye by its
unrivalled luxuriance. But if the forms are familiar, how
strange is the substance, of this ancient vegetation! The
forest tree has been turned into sandstone; many of
the plants are of the hardest flint; and the rich green of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
the fern has given place to the jet black color of coal. Let
him take a magnifying glass and scrutinize the internal
structure of these mineralized remains; for the more closely
they are examined the more wonderful do they appear.
He can observe without difficulty their minute cells and
fibres, the exact counterpart of those which may be seen
in the plants that are now growing upon the earth; he may
detect the little seed-vessels on the under surface of the
coaly fern; nay, if he gets a polished transverse section of
the sandstone tree, he may count the rings that mark its
annual growth, and tell the age it attained in its primeval
forest.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">From</span> the galleries of the Museum we must now
descend into the subterranean recesses of the
mine and the quarry. For it is not enough to be
familiar with the appearance of Fossil Remains, as they
are laid out for show by human hands: we must see them
also as they lie embedded in the successive strata of the
Earth’s Crust, which are the shelves of Nature’s cabinet.
We shall begin with the celebrated quarries of Monte
Bolca, in Northern Italy, not far from Verona. Here, in
the hard limestone rock, fifty miles from the nearest sea,
entire skeletons of many different species of fish are found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
embedded in profuse abundance, and in a wonderful state
of preservation. They lie parallel to the layers of the
rock; and, though flattened by pressure, still retain their
scales, bones, fins, nay, even their muscular tissue, undisturbed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
and unharmed. Their color is a deep brown,
which forms a remarkable contrast with the creamy hue of
the limestone in which they are enveloped. The quarries
have been worked only by students of Natural History for
the sake of Organic remains, and are, therefore, of very
limited extent; yet so abundant are these fossil treasures
that upward of a hundred different species have been discovered,
and thousands of specimens have been dispersed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
over the cabinets of Europe. So closely are they sometimes
packed together that many individuals are contained
in a single block.</p>

</div>

<p>From these facts Geologists have been led to conclude:&mdash;that
the strata in question were deposited on the bed of an
ancient sea in which these fishes swam; that the waters
of the sea were suddenly rendered noxious, probably by the
eruption of volcanic matter; that the fishes in consequence
perished in large numbers, and were then almost immediately
embedded in the calcareous deposits of which the
strata are composed. These views receive no small confirmation
from a very remarkable phenomenon to which we
may be allowed, in passing, to call attention. In the year
1831 a volcanic island was suddenly thrown up in the Mediterranean
between Sicily and the African coast; and the
waters of the sea were at the same time observed to be
charged with a red mud over a very wide area, while hundreds
of dead fish were seen floating on the surface. Is it
not pretty plain that when the mud subsided many of the
fish were enveloped in the deposit, and thus preserved to
future times? If so, then, we should have an exact modern
parallel to the fossil fishes of Monte Bolca. But for
the present it is our purpose rather to describe facts than to
develop theories.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p>Near the town of Aix, the ancient capital of Provence, in
the south of France, is a group of strata, consisting chiefly
of Conglomerate, Marl, Gypsum, and Limestone, which
has earned for itself no small fame in the annals of Geology.
Besides many curious relics of an extinct vegetation,
these strata yield also an abundance of Fossil Insects, which
emerge from the rocky bed in which they have slept for
ages, with a surprising freshness and a life-like reality. But
the quarries of Aix, like those of Monte Bolca, are chiefly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
famous for their Fossil Fish. And in this case, too, as in
the former, it would seem as if vast multitudes had suddenly
perished together from some mysterious cause, and
were then as suddenly entombed. They exhibit no mark
of mechanical violence: and yet they are found, not unfrequently,
crowded together as closely as they can fit, in every
variety of position, on the same slab of limestone. A good
example of such a block is represented in our woodcut.</p>

<div id="fig_16" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_16.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 16.&mdash;Fossil Fish from Aix.</p>
</div>

<p>The White Chalk Rock of Sussex has been rendered classical
to the students of Geology by the skilful and laborious
researches of the late Doctor Mantell. Previous to his time
the Fish of the Chalk were known only by their teeth and
bones, which abounded in every quarry. But he succeeded
in bringing to light many whole skeletons, and disengaging
them without injury from their chalky envelopment. In
many cases these Fossil Fish appear to have suffered little
from compression: the body still retains its rounded form;
and even the most delicate scales and fins are as little disturbed
or distorted as if the original had been surrounded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
by soft Plaster of Paris while floating in the water. For
many years Doctor Mantell devoted himself, with indefatigable
zeal, to the gathering of these interesting remains;
and his magnificent collection now adorns the Galleries of
the British Museum. In the annexed illustration is figured
a specimen belonging to one of the most abundant species.
It is closely allied to the common perch; and is popularly
called Johnny Dory by the quarrymen of Sussex, but is
entitled Beryx Lewesiensis by the learned.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>

<p>From Fossil Fish we now turn to Fossil Reptiles. Many
of our readers have, perhaps, heard or read something
about an important group of rocks known by the name of
the Lias. This formation is well developed in England,
and has received much attention from Geologists. It
stretches in a belt of varying width from Whitby on the
coast of Yorkshire to Lyme Regis on the coast of Dorsetshire;
passing in its course through the counties of Leicester,
Warwick, Gloucester, and Somerset. It is composed
chiefly of Limestone, Marl, and Clay; and is celebrated for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
the number and size of its great Fossil Reptiles. Of these
the most remarkable is the Ichthyosaurus or Fish-like
Lizard.</p>

<p>This monster of the ancient seas combined, as its name
denotes, the essential characters of a reptile with the form
and habits of a fish. No such creature has been known to
exist within historic times; nevertheless, all the various
parts of its complicated structure have their analogies, more
or less perfect, in the present creation. It had the head of
a Lizard, the beak of a Porpoise, the teeth of a Crocodile, the
back bone of a Fish, and the paddles of a Whale. In length
it sometimes exceeded thirty feet; it had a short thick neck,
an enormous stomach, a long and powerful tail. This last
appendage, together with four great paddles or fins, constituted
the chief organs of motion. But of all its parts the head
was perhaps the most wonderful and characteristic. In the
larger species the jaws were six feet long, and were armed with
two rows of conical sharp-pointed teeth,&mdash;a hundred below,
a hundred and ten above. The cavities in which the eyes
were set measured often fourteen inches across, and the
eyeballs themselves must have been larger than a man’s
head.</p>

<p>Now what we want particularly to impress upon our
readers is, that the remains of this singular aquatic reptile
abound throughout the whole extent of the Lias Formation
in England. Far down below the surface of the earth
they are found embedded in the marls, and clays, and
limestones of Dorsetshire, and Gloucester, and Warwick,
and Leicester, and Yorkshire. Sometimes whole
skeletons are found entire, with scarcely a single bone removed
from the place it occupied during life; but more
frequently the scattered fragments are found lying about in
a state of confused disorder; skulls, and jaw-bones, and
teeth, and paddles, and the joints of the vertebral column and
of the tail. The neighborhood of Lyme Regis is a perfect
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
cabinet of these curious treasures. In some of the specimens
there exhumed, a singular circumstance has been
observed, which is deserving of special notice. We should
naturally have expected, from the prodigious power of this
animal, from the expansion of his jaws and the immense
size of his stomach, that he preyed upon the other fish and
reptiles that had the misfortune to inhabit the waters in
which he lived. And so indeed it was. For here enclosed
within his vast ribs, in the place that once was his stomach,
are still preserved the remains of his half-digested food;
and amidst the d&eacute;bris we can distinguish the bones and
scales of his victims. Nay, in some of the more colossal
specimens of this ancient monster, we can distinctly recognize
the remains of his own smaller brethren; which,
though less frequent than the bones of fishes, are still sufficiently
numerous to prove that, when he wanted to appease
his hunger, he did not even spare the less powerful members
of his own species.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is with facts like these, which are revealed by the Crust
of the Earth all over the world, that Geologists are called
upon to deal. When they meet with skeletons and bones
such as we have been describing, buried deep in the hard
rock, hundreds of feet beneath the green grass, and the
waving corn, they cannot help but ask the question:
Where did these creatures come from? When did they
live? And by what revolutions were they embedded here,
and lifted up from beneath the waters of the deep?</p>

<p>In the same formation are found the remains of another
ancient reptile, called the Plesiosaurus, that is to say,
nearly allied to the Lizard. Of this extraordinary monster
Cuvier observed that its structure was the most singular
and anomalous that, up to his time, had been discovered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
amid the ruins of the ancient world. It is chiefly distinguished
from the Ichthyosaurus, to which it has no small
affinity, by the enormous length of its neck, which, in some
species, resembles the body of a serpent. Dr. Buckland
tells us that in the Plesiosaurus Dolichodeirus the neck is
longer than the trunk; the one being five times, the other
only four times, as long as the head. Our illustration, for
which we are indebted to the kindness of Doctor Haughton,
represents a fine specimen of Plesiosaurus Cramptonii,
which was found in the Lias Beds of Kettleness, near
Whitby, in Yorkshire, and which is now a prominent object
in the Museum of the Royal Dublin Society.</p>

<p>The habits and character of the Plesiosaurus have been
thus sketched out by Mr. Conybeare:&mdash;“That it was aquatic
is evident, from the form of its paddles; that it was marine
is almost equally so, from the remains with which it is universally
associated; that it may have occasionally visited
the shore, the resemblance of its extremities to those of the
turtle may lead us to conjecture. Its motion, however,
must have been very awkward on land; its long neck must
have impeded its progress through the water; presenting a
striking contrast to the organization which so admirably
fits the Ichthyosaurus to cut through the waves. May it not
therefore be concluded (since, in addition to these circumstances,
its respiration must have required frequent access
of air), that it swam upon or near the surface; arching back
its long neck like the swan, and occasionally darting it
down at the fish which happened to float within its reach.
It may perhaps have lurked in shoal water along the coast
concealed among the sea-weed, and raising its nostrils to a
level with the surface from a considerable depth, may have
found a secure retreat from the assaults of dangerous enemies;
while the length and flexibility of its neck may have
compensated for the want of strength in its jaws, and its
incapacity for swift motion through the water, by the suddenness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
and agility of the attack which they enabled it to
make on every animal fitted for its prey, which came
within its reach.”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p>

<p>The Pampas of South America are not less famous in
Geology for the remains of Gigantic quadrupeds, than the
Lias of England for its colossal marine reptiles. These
vast undulating plains, which present to the eye for nine
hundred miles a waving sea of grass, consist chiefly of stratified
beds of gravel and reddish mud; and it is in these beds
that the remains of many unshapely but powerful terrestrial
animals have been found embedded. So abundant are
they, that it is said a line drawn in any direction through
the country would cut through some skeleton or bones.
Indeed, Mr. Darwin is of opinion that the whole area of the
Pampas is one wide sepulchre of these extinct animals.
It will be enough for our purpose to describe one in particular,
which, from its prodigious bulk, has received the
appropriate name of Megatherium, or the Great Wild Beast.</p>

<p>The Megatherium, like the Ichthyosaurus and the Plesiosaurus,
had many affinities with the existing creation. In its
head and shoulders it resembled the sloth which still
browses on the green foliage of the trees in the dense forests
of South America; while in its legs and feet it combined
the characteristics of the Ant-Eater and the Armadillo. But
it was eminently distinguished from these and all the other
modern representatives of the family to which it belonged
by its colossal proportions. It was often twelve feet long
and eight feet high; its fore-feet were a yard in length and
twelve inches in breadth, terminating in gigantic claws; its
haunches were five feet wide, and its thigh bone was three
times as big as that of the largest elephant. “His entire
frame,” as Dr. Buckland has admirably observed and carefully
demonstrated, “was an apparatus of colossal mechanism,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
adapted exactly to the work it had to do; strong and
ponderous, in proportion as this work was heavy, and calculated
to be the vehicle of life and enjoyment to a gigantic
race of quadrupeds, which, though they have ceased to be
counted among the living inhabitants of our planet, have,
in their fossil bones, left behind them imperishable monuments
of the consummate skill with which they were constructed,&mdash;each
limb, and fragment of a limb, forming
co-ordinate parts of a well adjusted and perfect whole;
and through all their deviations from the form and proportions
of the limbs of other quadrupeds, affording fresh
proofs of the infinitely varied and inexhaustible contrivances
of Creative Wisdom.”</p>

<p>“This Leviathan of the Pampas, as it has been justly called,
became first known in Europe toward the close of the last
century. In the year 1789 a skeleton was dug up, almost
entire, about three miles southwest of Buenos Ayres, and
was presented by the Marquis of Loreto to the Royal
Museum at Madrid, where it still remains. Since that time
other specimens, besides numerous fragments, have been
discovered, chiefly through the zeal and energy of Sir
Woodbine Parish; by the aid of which the form, structure,
and consequently the habits of this clumsy and ponderous
animal have been fully ascertained. The complete skeleton
which forms so prominent an object of attraction in the
British Museum, and which is represented in the woodcut
on the adjoining page, is only a model; but it has
been constructed with great care from the original bones,
some of which are to be found in the wall-cases of the
same room, and others in the Hunterian Museum of the
Royal College of Surgeons.”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>

<p>Closely allied to the Megatherium, but somewhat less
colossal in its dimensions, is the Mylodon. Its remains
are found associated with those of the Megatherium and
other great animals of the same family, in the superficial
gravels of South America. A splendid specimen, which
measures eleven feet from the fore part of the skull to the
end of the tail, was dug up, in the year 1841, a few miles
north of Buenos Ayres. It is well figured in the adjoining
woodcut, which we reproduce, by kind permission of
the Author, from Dr. Haughton’s admirable Manual of
Geology.</p>

<p>Passing from the petrified fish, and the reptiles, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
quadrupeds, that thus come forth, as it were, from their
graves to bring us tidings of an extinct creation, we must
next turn our attention for a moment to Fossil Shells.
These relics of the ancient world, which are scattered with
profuse abundance through all the strata of the Earth’s
Crust, may seem, indeed, of little value to the careless
observer; but to the practised eye of science they are full
of instruction. They have been aptly called the Medals of
Creation; for, stamped upon their surface they bear the
impress of the age to which they belong; and they constitute
the largest, we may say, perhaps, the most valuable
part of those unwritten records from which the Geologist
seeks to gather the ancient history of our Globe.</p>

<p>As regards the prodigious abundance of Fossil Shells
preserved in the Crust of the Earth, it is unnecessary for us
here to speak. We have already seen that the great mass
of many limestone formations is composed almost exclusively
of such remains, broken up into minute fragments,
and more or less altered by chemical agency; and besides,
there are quarries within the reach of all, where they may
collect at pleasure these interesting relics of the olden time.
But there are one or two facts of peculiar significance connected
with Fossil Shells, which it may be useful briefly
to set down. In the first place, we would remind our
readers that there is a marked and well-known difference
between the shells of those animals that can live only in
the sea, of those that inhabit rivers, and of those, finally,
that frequent the brackish waters of estuaries. Now it has
been made clear beyond all reasonable doubt, by the explorations
of Geologists, that sea-shells abound in great numbers
far away from the present line of coast, in the heart
of vast continents. And they are found, not merely on
the surface, but buried deep in the Crust of the Earth, and
overlaid, in many cases, by numerous strata of solid rock,
thousands of feet in thickness. It is also to be observed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
that they occur at all heights above the level of the ocean;
having been discovered at an elevation of eight thousand
feet in the Pyrenees, ten thousand in the Alps, thirteen
thousand in the Andes, and above eighteen thousand in the
Himalaya.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> Such are the phenomena which are constantly
forcing themselves on the attention of the Geologist, and
which involve a number of problems that he cannot help
attempting to investigate and explain. He is instinctively
impelled to ask himself, how can the shells of marine
animals have come to exist so far away from the sea? how
have they been buried in the Crust of the Earth? how have
they been lifted up to the highest pinnacles of lofty mountains?</p>

<p>Our subterranean exploration would be incomplete if it
did not illustrate the Vegetable as well as the Animal Life
of the ancient world. Let the reader then descend in fancy
into the celebrated quarries of Portland on the south coast
of England, and he will see the fossilized remains of a long
past vegetation exhibited in a very striking manner. In one,
of these quarries a vertical section, extending from the surface
downward to the depth of about thirty feet, presents
the following succession of strata arranged in horizontal
layers:&mdash;first, a light covering of vegetable soil, beneath
which are thin beds of cream-colored limestone, forming a
stratum of solid rock ten feet thick; then a bed of dark-brown
loam, mixed with rounded fragments of stone, and
varying in thickness from twelve to eighteen inches. This
is known to the quarrymen by the name of Dirt-bed, and
seems, in former ages, to have supported a luxuriant vegetation;
for all around are scattered the petrified fragments
of an ancient forest. The prostrate stems and shattered
branches of great trees are met at every step; but what is
most striking and peculiar is, that, in many cases, the petrified
stumps are still standing erect, with their roots fixed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
in the thin stratum of loam, and their trunks stretching
upward into the hard limestone rock. Immediately below
the Dirt-bed is another thick stratum of limestone, and
below this again is a stratum of the famous Portland stone,
so highly prized for building purposes. As the quarries of
Portland are worked chiefly for the sake of this building
stone, little attention is paid to the Dirt-bed and its contents,
which are commonly thrown aside by the quarrymen
as rubbish.</p>

<p>The scene of this petrified forest is thus described by
Doctor Mantell:&mdash;“On one of my visits to the island the
surface of a large area of the Dirt-bed was cleared preparatory
to its removal, and the appearance presented was most
striking. The floor of the quarry was literally strewn with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
fossil wood, and before me was a petrified forest, the trees
and plants, like the inhabitants of the city in Arabian story,
being converted into stone, yet still remaining in the places
which they occupied when alive! Some of the trunks were
surrounded by a conical mound of calcareous earth, which
had, evidently, when in the state of mud, accumulated
round the roots. The upright trunks were generally a few
feet apart, and but three or four feet high; their summits
were broken and splintered, as if they had been snapped or
wrenched off by a hurricane at a short distance from the
ground. Some were two feet in diameter, and the united
fragments of one of the prostrate trunks indicated a total
length of from thirty to forty feet; in many specimens portions
of the branches remained attached to the stem.”<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></p>

<p>The Coal Measures of Europe and America offer to the
student of Geology a boundless field for the investigation of
Fossil Plants and Trees. We have already had occasion to
notice the Sigillaria. This ancient tree, remarkable for its
beautiful sculptured stem, has no exact representative in
the vegetable kingdom of the present day. But it abounds
everywhere in the Coal Measures; and there seems little
doubt that several great seams of Coal are composed almost
entirely of its carbonized remains. Indeed the ancient soil,
which commonly constitutes the floor on which the bed of
Coal reposes, is often as thickly crowded with the branching
roots of the Sigillaria, as the soil of a dense forest with
the roots of the trees by which it is covered. The stem
itself, when converted into Coal, generally assumes the
form of long narrow slabs; having been flattened by pressure
during the process of mineralization. Sometimes,
however, it is found uncompressed and erect. In this case
the interior of the trunk is usually observed to have been
filled up with sand or clay: and thus the forest tree, still
retaining its external shape and character, is transformed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
into a cylindrical shell of carbonized bark without, and a
solid cylinder of sandstone or shale within. An interesting
example is exhibited in our illustration, Figure 11.</p>

<p>Every Coal mine, too, is adorned with the imprint of the
graceful Fern, which constitutes one of the most attractive
features in the Flora of the ancient world. Not unfrequently
it assumes a tree-like character, as it often does even
now in tropical countries; and then, indeed, it is an object
of striking beauty, reaching to a height of forty or fifty feet,
and expanding at the summit into an elegant canopy of
foliage.</p>

<p>The Calamite is another plant in which the Coal abounds.
Its true botanical character is not yet clearly ascertained;
but it bears a general resemblance, except for its gigantic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
dimensions, to the common Horse-tail of our swamps and
marshy grounds. It is a reed-like, jointed stem, sometimes
thirty feet in length, hollow within, and curiously jointed
without.</p>

<p>Scarcely less conspicuous than the Sigillaria, the Fern,
and the Calamite, is the Lepidodendron or Scaly Tree, one
of the most curious and interesting among the plants of the
Coal-bearing period. Like the Sigillaria and the Calamite,
it has been, and still is, a puzzle to the student of Botany.
But it needs not the eye of science to see that it is unmistakably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
a stately forest tree, shut up in the Crust of the
Earth, encased in a solid framework of indurated Shale,
or Sandstone, or Coal, as the case may be, and overlaid
with massive strata of rock hundreds of feet in thickness.
Such a specimen as that represented in our woodcut was
laid bare some years ago in Yarrow Colliery, near Newcastle.</p>

<div id="fig_26" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_26.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 26 Lepidodendron Elegans.

</div>

<p>In the same neighborhood was found a portion of the
stem and branches of another variety, Lepidodendron Elegans,
which will enable the reader to form a more complete
idea of the appearance presented by this ancient tree as it
stood in its primeval forest.</p>

<p>An unusually favorable illustration of our present subject
may be seen at the colliery of Treuil, in France, not far
from the city of Lyons. The beds of Coal are overlaid by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
a kind of slaty sandstone, ten feet thick; and this sandstone
is traversed by the vertical stems of enormous petrified
plants, chiefly Calamites. Here, then, to all appearance,
we have an ancient forest enveloped in sandstone. We
must suppose that the forest was submerged while the trees
were still erect; that in this condition it received the sedimentary
deposits carried down by the current of some great
river; and finally, that these deposits were, in the course
of ages, compacted into sandstone by a process already explained.
It would seem that after the sandstone had been
partially, at least, consolidated, it was subjected to a sliding
movement here and there, by which the continuity of the
stems was broken; the upper part being pushed on one
side, as shown in our Figure.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 27.&mdash;Section of a Coal sandstone at Treuil, near Lyons.

</div>

<p>It is time we should bring to a close our survey, meagre
and imperfect as it is, of Fossil Remains. Those who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
desire to pursue the inquiry for themselves will easily find
an opportunity of doing so. There are few, we should
suppose, who may not, occasionally, have access to one
or other of those splendid Museums of Geology, which
have been set up in all the great towns of Europe. And
the still more extensive cabinets of Nature’s Museum,
spread out beneath our feet, are within the reach of all.</p>

<p>But even the scanty facts which have been set forth faithfully,
we trust, though perhaps feebly, in these pages, are
sufficient to satisfy all reasonable minds that the bones, the
skeletons, the trunks and branches of trees, which have
been exhumed from the Stratified Rocks are really the
remains of Organic Life that once flourished on the earth,
or in the waters of the ancient seas. Obvious, however, as
this fact must appear to all who have fully realized the character
and appearance of Fossil Remains, it has been often
vigorously assailed and vehemently denounced. In the early
days of Geology phenomena of this kind were ascribed, not
uncommonly, to the “plastic power of Nature,” or to the influence
of the stars. Such notions, however, meet with little
support among modern writers. They were nothing more
than wild fancies, without any foundation either in the evidence
of facts or in the analogy of Nature. The “plastic
power of Nature” was a phrase that sounded well, perhaps,
in the ears of unreflecting people; but no one ever undertook
to show that Nature really possesses that “plastic
power” which was so readily imputed to her. No one ever
undertook to show that it is the way of Nature to make the
stems, and branches, and leaves of trees, without the previous
process of vegetation; or to make bones and skeletons
which have never been invested with the ordinary
appendages of flesh and blood. Yet surely this is a theory
that requires proof; for all our experience of the laws of
Nature points directly to the opposite conclusion. And as
for the influence of the stars, we may be content to adopt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
the language of the celebrated painter Leonardo da Vinci:&mdash;“They
tell us that these shells were formed in the hills
by the influence of the stars; but I ask where in the hills
are the stars now forming shells of distinct ages and species?
and how can the stars explain the origin of gravel
occurring at different heights and composed of pebbles
rounded as if by the action of running water? or in what
manner can such a cause account for the petrifaction in the
same places of various leaves, sea-weeds, and marine crabs?”<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p>In modern times the form of objection has been somewhat
changed. We are told by some writers that, when
we seek to explain the existence of Fossil Remains by the
action of natural laws, we seem to forget the Omnipotence
of God. They urge upon us, with much solemnity, that
He could have made bones, and shells, and skeletons, and
petrified wood, though there had been no living animal to
which these bones belonged, and no living tree that had been
changed into stone. And if He made them, might He not
disperse them up and down through His creation, on the
lofty mountains, in the hidden valleys, and in the profound
depths of the sea? and buried them in limestone rocks
and in the soft clay? and arranged them in groups, or
scattered them in wild confusion as He best pleased?</p>

<p>To this line of argument we must be content to reply,
that we have no wish to limit the power of God. But we
have learned from our daily experience that in the physical
world He is pleased to employ the agency of secondary
causes; and when we know that for many ages a certain
effect has been uniformly produced by a certain cause, and
not otherwise, then if we again see the effect, we infer the
cause. When a traveller in the untrodden wilds of Western
America, comes upon a forest of great trees, or a herd
of unknown animals, surely he never thinks of supposing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
that the wild beasts and the forest trees came directly from
the hand of the Creator, in that state of maturity in which
he beholds them. And why? for it might be argued that
the power of God is unbounded, and he might have created
them as they now are if He had so pleased. Is it not that
the traveller is impelled, by an instinct of his nature, to
interpret the works of God which he now sees for the first
time, according to the analogy of those with which he has
been long familiar? Now this is just the principle for which
we are contending. According to all our experience of
the works of God in the physical world, the living body
comes first, and the skeleton afterward; the living tree
comes first, and afterward the prostrate trunk and the splintered
branches. Therefore when we meet with a skeleton,
we conclude that it was once a living body; and when we
find the petrified stems, and branches, and leaves of trees,
we have no doubt that they are the remains of an ancient
vegetation.</p>

<p>But, in truth, if any one, with all the facts of the case
fully before his mind, were deliberately to adopt this theory,
that Fossils, as we find them now, were created by God in
the Crust of the Earth, we candidly confess we have no
argument that we should think likely to shake his conviction;
just as we should be utterly at a loss if he were to
say that the Pyramids of Egypt, or the colossal sculptures
of Nineveh, or the ruins of Baalbec, were created by God
from the beginning. The evidence of human workmanship
is certainly not more clear in the one case than is the
evidence of animal and vegetable life in the other. We
believe, however, that no such persons are to be found; that
theories of this kind have their origin, not so much in false
reasoning, as in imperfect knowledge of facts; and we have,
therefore, judged it most expedient not to spend our time
in a discussion of philosophical axioms, but to set forth the
facts, and leave them to speak for themselves.

Go where you will through the civilized world,

the plunder which has been going on for two
centuries or more, you will find that the inexhaustible
cabinets of Nature are still teeming with these remains
of ancient life.</p>

<p>When we are brought, for the first time, face to face with
these countless relics of a former world, we are impressed
with a sense of wonder and bewilderment. That the skeletons
before us, though now dry and withered, were once
animated with the breath of life; that the trees now lying
shattered and prostrate, and shorn of their branches, once
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
flourished on the earth, we cannot for a moment hesitate
to believe. But beyond this one fact, all is darkness and
mystery. These gaunt skeletons, these uncouth monsters,
these petrified forests, are silent, lifeless, as the rocks within
whose stony bosoms they have lain so long entombed.
Had they speech and memory, they could tell us much,
no doubt, of that ancient world in which they bore a part,
of its continents, and seas, and rivers, and mountains; of
the various tribes of animals and plants by which it was
peopled; of their habits and domestic economy; how they
lived, how they died, and how they were buried in those
graves from which, after the lapse of we know not how
many ages, they now come forth into the light of day. As
it is, however, we can but gaze and wonder. We have
nothing here but the relics of death and destruction: there
is no feeling, no memory, no voice, in these dry bones; no
living tenant in these hollow skulls, to recount to us the
history of former times.</p>

<p>So thinks and reasons the ordinary observer. But far
different is the language of the Geologist. These dry and
withered bones, he tells us, <i>are</i> gifted with memory and
speech; and, though the language they speak may seem
at first unfamiliar and obscure, it is not, on that account,
beyond our comprehension. Like the birds, reptiles, fish,
and other symbols, inscribed on the obelisks of ancient
Egypt, these bones and shells stored up in the Crust of the
Earth, have a hidden meaning which it is the business of
Science to search out and explain. They are Nature’s
hieroglyphics, which she has impressed upon her works to
carry down to remote ages the memory of the revolutions
through which our Globe has passed; and when we come
to understand them aright, they do unfold to us the story
of that ancient world to which they belonged.</p>

<p>The interpretation of Fossil Remains is, then, an important
department of Geology. Of late years it has been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
admitted to the rank of a special science, under the name
of Pal&aelig;ontology, which means, as the word denotes&mdash;παλαιῶν
ὄντων λόγος&mdash;the science which is concerned about
the organic remains of ancient life. The honor of having
been the first to place this science on a solid basis, in fact
we may say the honor of having brought it into existence, is
justly accorded to the distinguished Cuvier, whose name
shed a lustre upon France during the early years of the
present century. It is therefore still in its infancy; but it
has already rewarded the zeal of its students by many wonderful
and unexpected revelations. We purpose in the
first place to examine the principles on which it is founded,
and then to take a rapid glance at the conclusions to which
it has led.</p>

<p>At the outset it is worthy of notice that the very existence
of Fossil Remains, buried deep in the Crust of the Earth,
forcibly confirms the Geological theory of Stratified Rocks.
These rocks, as the reader will remember, are said to have
been slowly spread out, one above another, during the
lapse of many ages, by the operation of natural causes; and
we have seen how this doctrine is supported by arguments
founded on an examination of the rocks themselves,&mdash;of
the materials that compose them, and of the way in which
these materials are piled together. Now let us observe how
clearly the testimony of Fossil Remains seems to point in
the same direction.</p>

<p>First, the bones and shells which we now find in such
profusion, far down beneath the superficial covering of the
Earth, must have belonged to animals which, when living,
flourished on what was then the surface. Yet now they
are buried in the bosom of the hard rock, and covered
over with beds of solid limestone, and sandstone, and conglomerate,
hundreds and thousands of feet in thickness.
How can we explain this fact, unless we suppose that these
animals, when they perished, were embedded in some soft
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
materials, which afterward became consolidated, and above
which, in the course of ages, more and more matter was
deposited, until at length that lofty pile of strata was produced,
beneath which the remains are now found buried?</p>

<p>Again, it is part of our theory that the formation of
Stratified Rocks took place, for the most part, under water.
The Organic Remains, therefore, which we should naturally
expect to find preserved in the strata of the earth,
would be those of aquatic animals; or, if the remains of
land animals were to be looked for, it should be of those
chiefly which live near the banks of rivers and estuaries,
and which, after death, might have been carried down by
the current and buried in the silt and mud with which
almost all rivers are charged at certain seasons of the year.
We know as a fact that such animals are buried at the
present day in the Deltas of the Ganges and the Mississippi;
and it would be reasonable to suppose that the same
should have occurred in former ages. Now here again the
evidence of Fossil Remains exactly fits in with our theory.
For the vast bulk of them are manifestly the remains of
animals that lived in water: and the terrestrial animals,
comparatively few, whose bones are preserved in the Crust
of the Earth, are such as frequent the banks of great rivers
or the marshy swamps of estuaries.</p>

<p>Thus much we may learn even from a cursory glance at
Fossil Remains. But these curious monuments of ancient
times have a deeper meaning, which cannot be unfolded
without a more minute and laborious investigation. Our
readers are aware that all the animals at present existing
on the face of the Earth have been scientifically grouped
together, according to certain well-marked characteristics,
into various Kingdoms, Classes, Genera, and Species.
Thus, for example, the horse and the dog are two different
Species, belonging to the same Class of Mammalia; the
eagle and the sparrow are two different Species of the same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
Class called Birds. Then again the Class of Mammalia
and the Class of Birds both belong to the one common
Kingdom of Vertebrata; because, though different in many
other respects, they agree in this, that all the members of
both Classes have a vertebral or spinal column, to which
the other parts of the internal skeleton are attached.</p>

<p>Now when Cuvier began to examine closely the Organic
Remains of former times, to which his attention was called
by the bones dug up in the gypsum quarries of Montmartre,
near Paris, about the close of the last century, he brought
with him to the task a very large acquaintance with the
various forms of life that, in the present age, prevail
throughout the world. And he was greatly struck with
the marked difference between those living animals with
which he had been long familiar, and those with which
he now became acquainted for the first time. The more
he extended his researches, the more manifest did this difference
appear; until at last it became quite clear that
the great bulk of the animals whose remains are preserved
in the Crust of the Earth, have no representatives
now living on its surface. Nevertheless, he observed that,
though the Species no longer exists, it often happens that
we have still other Species of the same Genus; or if the
Genus, too, be extinct, we have other Genera of the same
Class. Here, then, is the first great truth at which Cuvier
arrived, and which has been since confirmed by extensive
observations:&mdash;that the animals which formerly dwelt on
this Earth of ours, were, for the most part, widely different
from those by which it is now inhabited: and yet there is a
well-defined likeness between them; that both have been
created on a plan so strictly uniform, that the one and the
other naturally find their place in the same system of classification.</p>

<p>As the science of Pal&aelig;ontology progressed, and new
facts were day by day accumulated, another truth, not less
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
important, was gradually but certainly developed. In the
distribution of Fossil Remains through the various strata
of the Earth, there is a certain order observed, a certain
regular law of succession, which cannot have been the
mere result of chance, and which it is the business of
science to unravel and explain. The facts are these. If
we follow a particular set of strata <i>in a horizontal direction</i>,
we find that the same fossils continue to prevail over hundreds
of square miles, nay, often over a space as large as
Europe, though beyond certain limits this uniformity of
Fossil Remains will gradually be observed to disappear.
But when we penetrate <i>in a vertical direction</i> through the
strata, the forms of animal and vegetable life that we meet
with are constantly changing. After a few hundred yards
at the most, we find ourselves in the midst of a group of
fossils, altogether different from those which we have passed
in the beds above: and so on, as we proceed downward,
<i>each particular set of strata is found to have an assemblage of
fossils peculiar to itself</i>.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<p>There can be no reasonable doubt as to the truth of these
facts. They have been established and confirmed by the
positive testimony of a whole host of Geologists, whose
researches have extended to all parts of the globe. And we
have besides a kind of negative evidence on the subject
which is scarcely less convincing than the positive. Nothing
is more easy than to refute a universal proposition if it is
false. If it is not a fact that each group of strata, as we proceed
downward, exhibits a collection of Fossils peculiar to
itself, the assertion may be at once disproved by pointing
out two or three different groups with the same Fossils.
There are thousands of practical Geologists at work all over
the world, eager for fame; and any one of them would
make his name illustrious if he could overturn a theory so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
generally received. Now, when a statement of facts can be
easily disproved if untrue; and when, at the same time,
there is a large number of men whose interest it would be
to disprove the statement if possible; and when it is nevertheless
<i>not</i> disproved; this circumstance, we contend, is a
convincing argument that the alleged facts <i>are</i> true. And
such precisely is the case before us. We therefore think it
would be unreasonable not to accept the facts.</p>

<p>Let us next examine what is their significance. Each
group of strata, be it remembered, represents to us the
animal life that flourished on the Earth during the period
in which that particular group was in progress of formation.
It is, as it were, a cabinet in which are preserved for
our instruction certain relics or memorials of that age in
the world’s history. Of course it is not a perfect collection;
but only a collection of those remains that chanced to
escape destruction, and by some natural embalming process
to be saved from dissolution. When we learn, then,
that there is a marked uniformity in the assemblage of Fossils
that are spread over a large horizontal area, in any
group of strata, we conclude that, when that group was in
course of formation, there was a certain uniformity in the
animal life that extended over the corresponding area of the
globe; just as, at the present day, the same species of animals
are found to flourish over a great part of Europe, or
America. And if this uniformity of Fossil Remains does
not extend horizontally to an indefinite distance, this is precisely
what we should have expected from the analogy of
the existing creation: for, when we examine the present
distribution of animal life over the earth, we find a marked
diversity to exist between countries that are removed from
one another; as, for instance, between Europe and Australia.</p>

<p>In the next place, we are told that, as we proceed <i>downward</i>
into the Crust of the Earth, each successive group of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
strata has an assemblage of Fossils clearly distinct in character
from those of the group above and of the group
below. The conclusion to which this fact points is obvious
enough. If, in the former case, we inferred that the animal
life of any one period, considered in itself, was the same
over extensive areas, in this case we must infer that the
animal life of each successive period was <i>peculiar to that
particular age</i>; being altogether distinct in its character
from the animal life of the period that went before and of
the period that followed. It would appear, therefore, as
Sir Charles Lyell puts it, “that from the remotest period
there has been ever a coming in of new organic forms, and
an extinction of those which pre-existed on the earth; some
species having endured for a longer, others for a shorter
time; while none have ever reappeared after once dying
out.”<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p>Now, from these principles, Geologists have been gradually
led to build up a system of Geological Chronology;
in other words, to determine the order of time in
which the numerous groups of strata that make up the
Crust of the Earth have been formed, and thus to fix the
age of each group in reference to the rest. This Chronology
is not reckoned by the common measures of time
which are used in history, but rather by the successive
periods during which each group of rocks was in its turn
slowly deposited on the existing surface of the globe. For
example, the Coal-measures that so abound in the North
of England are very much older than the bluish clay of
which London is built. But if we ask what is the difference
between the age of the one and of the other, the
answer is given not in days and years and centuries, but in
the number of different Formations that intervened between
the two. We are told that the Coal-measures belong to
the Carboniferous Formation; that this Formation was followed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
by the Permian, and that again in succession by the
Triassic, the Jurassic, and the Cretaceous; and that, upon
this last was spread out the Eocene, to which the London
clay belongs. Indeed, as regards the precise length of any
given period, Geologists can offer nothing but the wildest
conjectures. Some form their estimates in thousands of
years; others in millions. And the wisest amongst them
fairly confess they have no sufficient data to make an accurate
computation. Nevertheless, they are all agreed in this,
that the ages of which the memory is preserved in history,
that is to say, the last six thousand years, are but a small
part of one Geological period. Compared to the voluminous
chronicles laid up in the Crust of the Earth, the records
inscribed by human hands constitute but an insignificant
fraction of the world’s history. Our readers will be glad
to learn something of the way in which this startling system
of Geological Chronology is constructed and developed.</p>

<p>At first sight, perhaps, it might be imagined that the
order of time in which the various strata were deposited,
can be easily learned from the relative position in which
they lie. Since each stratum, when first produced, was
spread out on the existing surface of the globe, it is clear
that the one which lies uppermost in the series must be
the newest, then that which lies next below, and so on till
we reach the lowest of the pile, which must be the oldest
of all. Nothing could be more satisfactory than this reasoning,
if each stratum was spread out over the whole Earth,
and if, after having been once deposited, it was never afterward
removed. We might then regard each stratum as a
volume in the Natural History of the Globe, which, when
it was finished, was laid down upon that which contained
the chronicles of the preceding age; and thus the position
of every stratum would be in itself a sufficient evidence
of the age to which it belonged.</p>

<p>But such is not the case. Nowhere does the Crust of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
the Earth exhibit a complete series of the Stratified Rocks
laid out one above another. In any given section we can
find but a few only of the long series of groups that are
familiar to Geologists. And if we follow them on, in a
horizontal direction, we shall invariably find that some of
the strata will <i>thin out</i> and disappear, while new strata will
gradually be developed between two groups that were before
in immediate contact. Let it be observed, in passing,
that this fact fits in most perfectly with the theory we have
been all along defending. The Stratified Rocks were
deposited under water; therefore, the strata of any given
period were not <i>spread out over the whole Globe</i>, but at most
over those parts only which, for the time, were submerged.
With the next period came a change in the
boundaries of land and water; and the formation of strata
ceased in some localities and began in others: and so on
from epoch to epoch. Thus the areas over which the process
has been going on, have been, in every age, of limited
extent, and have been ever shifting from place to place
over the surface of the earth. Moreover, there is the opposite
process of Denudation. Many of the strata deposited
in the depths of the ocean must have been afterward swept
away by the breakers, as they slowly emerged from the
waters; or at a later time, reduced to their original elements,
and carried back to the sea, by the action of rivers,
rain, and frost. It should seem, therefore, as well from the
<i>fact</i>, which is obvious to any one who will examine it, as from
our <i>theory</i>, which harmonizes so completely with the fact,
that the strata which we meet with in any given section of
the Earth’s Crust present to us but a very broken and imperfect
series of monuments. They are, as it were, but
odd volumes of a long series, and though they lie in juxtaposition,
they may belong, nevertheless, to Geological epochs
widely removed from each other.</p>

<p>Hence, in order to construct a complete system of Geological
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
Chronology it is necessary to collect together these
odd volumes, as they may be called, of the Great Geological
Calendar, and to assign to each one its proper place in
the series. This difficult and complicated task is accomplished
chiefly by the aid of Fossil Remains. We have
already shown that the Fossil Remains which are found
embedded in each group of strata, represent the organic
life of the period during which that group of strata was in
progress of formation. Moreover, we have seen that each
period was marked by the existence of an animal and vegetable
creation peculiar to itself. If, therefore, we find that
the Fossils of two different districts exhibit the same general
character, we may conclude that the beds in which
they are preserved were deposited about the same age, and
consequently belong to the same Geological Period.
Whereas, on the other hand, if, within certain limits, we
discover two groups of strata, each of which has a collection
of Fossils totally different from the other, it is a proof
that these two groups were <i>not</i> deposited in the same age,
and must, consequently, be referred to different Epochs of
the Geological Calendar. Let us now see in what manner
the practical Geologist proceeds to apply these general
principles.</p>

<p>He takes first some one country, say England, and in
that country he selects some one particular district to begin
with. Here he examines a number of different sections,
and makes himself familiar with all the strata of the neighborhood,
and with the order in which they lie. Let us
suppose that he finds three different groups spread out one
above another, and let us call these groups A, B, and C;
A being the lowest, B immediately above A, and C above
B. The chronological order of these strata will be, therefore,
A, B, C. He will study next the Fossil Remains
which he finds embedded in each group. For convenience
we may designate the Fossils of A by the letter a, those of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
B by b, and those of C by c. Now, according to the
principles above explained, these three collections of Fossils
will be specifically distinct from one another, each collection
being characteristic of one particular set of strata.
Our Geologist next goes into a neighboring district, and
there examines a number of sections as before. Let us
suppose that he encounters again the groups A and B. He
may, perhaps, have been able to trace the beds from one
district to the other, by observations made upon his line of
route: or it may be that the nature of the country has rendered
such observations impossible; or the observations
may have been so imperfect that from <i>them</i> he could arrive
at no certain conclusion regarding the identity of the strata.
But, at all events, if the new district yield an abundant
supply of Fossils, he cannot long be at a loss. He will
recognize the group A by the Fossils a, and the group B
by the Fossils b. An important fact, however, soon
attracts his attention. Group C has entirely disappeared,
and is not to be found in this district; while between A
and B there is a new group of rocks that he has not seen before,
with a collection of Fossils different from a, b, and c.
We will call this new group X, and its Fossils x. It is clear
that the formation of X must have intervened between the
formation of A and B; and the chronological order now
stands A, X, B, C. In like manner another district may
disclose a fourth group of strata, say Y, intervening
between B and C. The chronological order will then
stand A, X, B, Y, C. And thus the Geologist pursues his
explorations until he has gone through the whole country,
and arranged the principal groups of strata according to
the order of time in which they were deposited.</p>

<p>In this way the whole of England has been minutely
explored during the last half century. The task was first
undertaken by William Smith, who is justly called the
Father of English Geology. After multiplied researches,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
extending over a space of many years, during which he
travelled the whole country on foot, this eminent man
published in 1815 his Geological Map of England and
Wales with part of Scotland; a work which is described
by Sir Charles Lyell as “a lasting monument of original
talent and extraordinary perseverance.” Hundreds followed
in the same course, exploring every day new districts, and,
by the new facts which they brought to light, supplying
what was wanting in the work of Smith, correcting what
was faulty, and confirming what was true; until at length,
in our day, it may be said that the Stratified Rocks of England
are almost as well known and as completely mapped
out as are its counties and its towns, its rivers, lakes, and
mountains.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Geologists were not idle in other parts of the
world. Germany, France, Italy, even many districts of
America and Australia, have been diligently explored
according to the same principles as England. And by a
comparison of the observations made, the Chronological
order of strata over a considerable part of the Earth, but
more particularly of Europe, has been now pretty fairly
ascertained. This order we have attempted to set forth in
an intelligible and sensible form by means of the table here
annexed.</p>

<p>In the Woodcut are represented the strata hitherto examined
by Geologists, laid out one above another, according
to the order of time in which they are supposed to have
been produced. The whole series is divided into a number
of Formations, the names of which are given in the first
column, together with an approximate estimate of their
thickness, in feet. These Formations are distinguished
from each other in the drawing by a difference of shading.
Each of them, according to Geological theory, is believed
to have come into existence by the accumulation of
solid matter at the bottom of the sea; and the Period of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
time occupied in its production is usually designated by the
same name as the Formation itself. Thus we read of the
Carboniferous Formation and the Carboniferous Period:
by the former phrase is meant certain groups of strata contemporaneously
deposited over various parts of the Earth’s
surface; and by the latter, the Period of time during which
these groups of strata were spread out. In like manner,
when we hear of the Carboniferous Fauna and Flora, we
are to understand the animal and vegetable life that flourished
during the Carboniferous Period. And again, when
Geologists talk of the Cretaceous sea, and tell us that it
rolled over a great part of what is now called Europe, they
mean to speak of that sea on the bottom of which the Cretaceous
rocks were deposited.</p>

<div id="img_211" class="figcenter">
<p class="caption large">TABLE OF STRATIFIED ROCKS,<br />
<span class="medium">CHRONOLOGICALLY ARRANGED.</span></p>
<img src="images/img_211.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Most of the Formations comprise various groups of
strata; and these groups are made up of different varieties
of rocks, which are again divided into layers or beds of
varying thickness. Even in these beds themselves we can
often distinguish an indefinite number of lamin&aelig; or plates,
scarcely thicker than a sheet of paper, which correspond to
the periodical depositions of matter by which the rock was
originally formed. These numerous subdivisions may be
conveniently illustrated from the Carboniferous Formation.
It is divided into two leading groups of strata; the Mountain
Limestone below, the Coal Measures above. The upper
group is the larger as well as the more important. It attains
a maximum thickness in South Wales of 12,000 feet; and
consists of numerous strata of Sandstone and Shale, with
thin seams of Coal occasionally interposed. In one
remarkable instance a hundred distinct layers of Coal, varying
in thickness from six inches to ten feet, have been
counted in one Coal-field, each resting on a bed of Shale,
called in mining phraseology the Underclay. This Shale
itself naturally divides into an indefinite number of thin
plates, just like the stratum of mud accumulated by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
annual inundations of the river Nile, and constituting the
present soil of Egypt.</p>

<p>We have not attempted to represent in our Woodcut
these various divisions and subdivisions of Stratified Rocks.
But the names of some important and well-known groups
we have had engraved, to impress more vividly on the mind
the place to which they are to be referred in the Geological
Calendar. Thus the reader may see at a glance the respective
ages of the Coal and the Chalk; of the Lias, in which
are preserved the remains of extinct gigantic reptiles, and
the Glacial Drift, in which the elephant, the rhinoceros,
and the hippopotamus are found entombed; of the Mountain
Limestone, which is often nothing else than vast beds
of Coral uplifted from beneath the waters of the ocean, and
the Oolite, which includes the Portland quarries, where the
petrified stems of ancient forest trees are found standing
erect in the solid rock.</p>

<p>As the series of Stratified Rocks is divided by Geologists
into a certain number or systems or Formations, so these
are again grouped into still larger classes, called Primary,
Secondary, and Tertiary; that is to say, first, second, and
third, in the order of formation. These larger classes correspond
to the Great Epochs or Ages of Geological time,
each comprising within itself many distinct Periods. The
Primary rocks are also called Pal&aelig;ozoic&mdash;παλαιὁν, ancient,
and ξῶον, an organic being&mdash;because they contain the oldest
forms of organic life: in like manner the term Mesozoic&mdash;μεσον,
middle, and ξῶον&mdash;is applied to the Secondary
strata, inasmuch as they contain the middle or intermediate
forms of organic life: and the name Kainozoic&mdash;χαινὁν,
new, and ξῶον&mdash;is given to the Tertiary, which contain
the newest forms of organic life.</p>

<p>The term Post-Tertiary has recently been adopted to
designate those superficial deposits which are subsequent
to the Tertiary Age. They are divided into two groups;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
the Recent, which corresponds with the period of history,
and the Post-Pliocene which precedes it. Some writers
seem to think that these deposits, being so very insignificant
and so very modern when compared with the long
series of Stratified Rocks, are not truly Geological. But
this, we should say, is a mistaken view of the question.
It seems to us that even the minute layer of mud that is
deposited every day at the mouth of the Ganges or the Mississippi,
is linked on to the long chain of events which have
brought the Crust of the Earth into its present condition;
and, therefore, truly belongs to the science of Geology, and
is deserving of its proper place in Geological classification.</p>

<p>We may here observe that the names of the great Geological
Epochs are descriptive names; that is to say, the obvious
meaning of the words corresponds to the character
of the strata they are used to represent. Primary, Secondary,
Tertiary, mean First, Second, and Third, in the order
of formation: Pal&aelig;ozoic, Mesozoic, and Kainozoic, signify
that the strata so called are characterized by Ancient,
Middle, and Modern, forms of organic life. But it is very
often quite otherwise with the names of the several Formations:
and this is a point of no small importance to the
student of Geology. These names must be regarded simply
<i>as names</i> employed to designate the strata formed in
each successive period, and not exactly to describe their
character. They generally had their origin in some accidental
circumstance, or were derived from some particular
locality; and afterward, being perpetuated, gradually came
to receive a much more extended application than that
which the words themselves would seem to suggest. Thus,
for instance, the Cretaceous Formation is so called from
the remarkable stratum of white chalk (creta) which was
deposited during that period over a great part of Europe;
but it would be a mistake to suppose that the whole Formation
is made up of chalk. On the contrary, in different
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
localities it is composed of very different materials; near
Dresden, for example, it is a gray quartzose sandstone, and
in many parts of the Alps it is hard compact limestone.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>
Again, the Devonian Formation derives its name from
Devonshire, where the rocks of the Devonian period were
first minutely examined; but we must not therefore infer
that this Formation is peculiar to the county of Devon; it is
to be found in many other parts of England, also in Ireland,
and on the continent of Europe. So, too, another Formation
has received the name of Carboniferous, which literally
means Coal-bearing (carbo fero) because of the beds
of Coal which are sometimes associated with its strata; yet
this Formation is often found quite destitute of Coal over a
very extensive area.</p>

<p>In looking over our Table of strata the reader must have
noticed that the successive spaces in the Woodcut are not
proportioned to the actual thickness of the successive
Formations for which they stand. The Secondary and
Tertiary Rocks taken together are scarcely one-third as
thick, in reality, as the Primary; yet they occupy an equal
space in the engraving: and, more remarkable still, the
Cretaceous system is allowed double the space of the Laurentian,
though less than half as thick. This circumstance
calls for a passing word of explanation. In the early
annals of a country there is generally a great scarcity of
authentic records; and, from a simple dearth of facts, the
history of a whole century is compressed, not unfrequently,
into a few pages: whereas, in later times, when documentary
evidence begins to accumulate, the historians will often
spread out the events of two or three years over several chapters.
Something of the same kind takes place in Geology.
The Fossil Remains, from which, as from authentic documents,
the Geologist chiefly derives his information regarding
the history of the Earth’s Crust, are scanty in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
earlier Formations, and abundant in the more recent. And
thus it happens that the older Geological Periods, notwithstanding
the vast thickness of the rocks by which they
are represented, do not occupy a very prominent position
in the annals of Geology, and are compressed into a comparatively
insignificant space in its Tables. Nevertheless,
the immense depth of the earliest Stratified Rocks must be
taken into account in any attempt to estimate the comparative
duration of the several Geological Periods. We have,
therefore, set down, under the name of each Formation,
an approximate estimate of its actual thickness, taken
chiefly from the works of Doctor Haughton and Sir Charles
Lyell.</p>

<p>Before bringing this chapter to an end we would observe
that the system of classification we have here endeavored to
explain does not pretend to be final and complete. It is,
on the contrary, little more than a temporary expedient to
render intelligible the results at which Geologists have
hitherto arrived; and is liable to manifold modifications in
proportion as their acquaintance with the records they have
undertaken to interpret becomes more extensive and more
minute. All that they now contend for is this: that the
successive Formations represent successive Periods of time,
which followed one another in the order here set forth, and
during which the Earth was peopled with certain species
of Plants and Animals, for the most part peculiar to their
respective eras.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">With</span> this sketch of Geological Chronology before
us, we can now more fully realize to our minds the
story we are told about the formation of the Earth’s
Crust. In the earliest age to which Geologists can trace
back the history of the Aqueous Rocks&mdash;for they do not profess
to trace it back to the beginning&mdash;this Globe of ours was,
as it is now, partly covered with water, and partly dry land.
The formation of stratified rocks went on in that age, as it is
still going on, chiefly over those areas that were under water&mdash;not
indeed throughout the entire extent of such areas, but
over certain portions of them to which mineral matter happened
to be carried by the action of natural causes. And
the Earth was peopled then as now, though with animals and
plants very different from those by which we are surrounded
at the present day. Some of these happened to escape
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
destruction, and to be embedded in the deposits of that far
distant age, and have thus been preserved even to our time.
And these strata with their Fossils are the same that we now
group together under the title of the Laurentian Formation:
which being the oldest group of stratified rocks we can
recognize in the depths of the Earth’s Crust, occupies the
lowest position in our table of Chronology. Ages rolled
on; and the Crust of the Earth was moved from within by
some giant force, the bed of the ocean was lifted up in one
place, islands and continents were submerged in another,
and so the outlines of land and water were changed. With
this change the old forms of life passed away; a new creation
came in; and the Laurentian period gave place to
the Cambrian. But the order of nature was still the same
as before. The deposition of stratified rocks still continued,
though the areas of deposition were, in many cases, shifted
from one locality to another. And the organic life that
flourished in the Cambrian times left its memorials behind
it buried in the Cambrian rocks. Then that age, too, came
to an end, and gave place in its turn to the Silurian: and
this was, again, followed by the Devonian. Thus one
period succeeded to another in the order set forth in our
table; and every part of the globe was, in the course of
ages, more than once submerged, and covered with the
deposits of more than one age, and enriched with the
Organic Remains of more than one creation.</p>

<p>As we advance upward in the series of Formations we
soon perceive that the Fossil Remains, which, in the
earlier groups were scanty enough, become profusely abundant,
until even the unpractised eye cannot fail to mark the
peculiar character of each successive period;&mdash;the exuberant
vegetation of the Carboniferous, with its luxuriant
herbage and its tangled forests, its huge pines, its tall tree-ferns,
and its stately araucarias: the enormous creeping
monsters of the Jurassic, the ichthyosaurs, the megalosaurs,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
the iguanodons, which filled its seas, or crowded its plains,
or haunted its rivers; and higher up in the scale, the colossal
quadrupeds of the Miocene and the Pliocene, the
mammoths, the mastodons, the megatheriums, which begin
to approximate more closely to the organic types of our
own age. But amidst these various forms of life, the eye
looks in vain for any relic of human kind. No bone of
man, no trace of human intelligence, is to be found in any
bed of rock that belongs to the Primary, Secondary, or
Tertiary Formations. It is only when we have passed all
these, and come to the latest formation of the whole series,
nay, it is only in the uppermost beds of this Formation, that
we meet, for the first time, with human bones, and the
works of human art.</p>

<p>Thus it appears pretty plain, even from the testimony of
Geology, that man was the last work of the creation; and
that, if the world is old, the human race is comparatively
young. These broken and imperfect records, which have
been so curiously preserved in the Crust of the Earth,
carry us back to an antiquity which may not be measured
by years and centuries, and then set before us, as in a palpable
form, how the tender herbage appeared, and the
fruit-tree yielding fruit according to its kind; and how the
Earth was afterward peopled with great creeping things,
and winged fowl, and the cattle, and the beasts of the
field; and then, at length, they disclose to us how, last of
all, man appeared, to whom all these things seem to tend,
and who was to have dominion over the fish of the sea, and
the fowl of the air, and every living thing that moveth upon
the earth. We do not mean to dwell just now upon this
view of the history of creation so clearly displayed in the
records of Geology. But we shall return to it hereafter
when we come in the sequel to consider how admirably the
genuine truths of this science fit in with the inspired narrative
of Moses.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span></p>

<p>It may here, very naturally, be asked, if the records of
Geology give us any information as to the manner in which
each period of animal and vegetable life was brought to an
end? Did the old organic forms gradually die out, and
the new gradually come in to take their places? or were
the one suddenly extinguished and the others as suddenly
produced? This question has been a subject of controversy
among Geologists themselves; and therefore it is
somewhat outside our scope, since we propose to exhibit
only that more general outline of Geological theory which is
accepted by all. Nevertheless, as it is a question that must
needs occur to the mind of every reader, it seems to call
for a few words of explanation as we pass along. In the
early days of Geology, it was commonly held that each
great period was brought to an end by a sudden and violent
convulsion of Nature. The Crust of the Earth was
burst open in many places all at once; the bottom of the
ocean was upheaved with a tremendous shock; the waters,
driven from their accustomed bed, rushed with furious
impetuosity over islands and continents; and the whole
existing creation perished in a universal deluge. Then
succeeded an interval of chaotic confusion, and when at
length the waters subsided, and dry land again appeared, a
new age in the history of the Globe was ushered in, and
the Earth was again peopled by a new creation.</p>

<p>But this old theory has gradually given way as the Stratified
Rocks have been more and more fully examined, and
at the present day it is almost universally abandoned.
Geologists have observed that the same species of Fossil
Remains which prevail in the upper beds of one Formation,
are met with also in the lower beds of the next, though in
less numbers and mixed up with new species; and that, as
we ascend higher and higher into the later Formation, the
old species gradually become more and more scarce,
while the new gradually become more and more numerous;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
until at length the characteristic forms of one age have disappeared
altogether, and those of the succeeding age have
attained their full development.</p>

<p>For this important fact, which was brought to light
within the last half century, we are mainly indebted to the
unwearied researches and great ability of Sir Charles Lyell.
Speaking of the Formations of the Tertiary Epoch, to
which, as is well known, he has principally devoted himself,
this distinguished writer thus sums up the result of his
long investigation:&mdash;“In passing from the older to the
newer members of the Tertiary system we meet with many
chasms, but none which separate entirely, by a broad line
of demarkation, one state of the organic world from
another. There are no signs of an abrupt termination of
one fauna and flora, and the starting into life of new and
wholly distinct forms. Although we are far from being
able to demonstrate geologically an insensible transition
from the Eocene to the Miocene, or even from the latter to
the recent fauna, yet the more we enlarge and perfect our
general survey, the more nearly do we approximate to such
a continuous series, and the more gradually are we conducted
from times when many of the genera and nearly all
the species were extinct, to those in which scarcely a single
species flourished which we do not know to exist at present.”<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a>
Hence he concludes, and his conclusion is now
the common doctrine of Geologists, that the extinction
and creation of species has been “the result of a slow and
gradual change in the organic world.”<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p>It was long argued against this view, that we often meet,
especially in the Primary and Secondary Formations, two
groups of strata in immediate contact, in which there is a
perfectly sudden transition from one set of Fossil Remains
to another altogether different. Each group contains a
countless variety of species, and yet there is not a single
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
species common to the two. Does it not appear that in
such a case the organic life of one period was suddenly
destroyed, and that of the next as suddenly introduced?
Not so; there is one link wanting in the argument. It
must be shown that these two strata which are now in <i>immediate
contact</i> were originally deposited in <i>immediate succession</i>.
But this it is impossible to prove: nay, it must needs
be very often false. We have before observed that the
areas of deposition were limited in every age, and were
ever shifting from one locality to another. Therefore it
must have been a frequent occurrence that, after one bed
of rock was formed, the process of deposition ceased altogether
in that locality, and did not begin again for many
ages. Thus a long lapse of time often intervened between
the deposition of two strata, which were laid out one immediately
above the other. Furthermore, we have also seen
that whole groups of strata may in any age be swept away
by Denudation; and then the rocks which are next deposited
in that locality, will be in immediate contact with
strata indefinitely more ancient than themselves. From these
considerations it is plain that two groups of strata which are
now found in juxtaposition, may have been deposited in
two Geological ages widely remote from each other. And
consequently a sudden transition from the Organic Life of
one group to the Organic Life of the other affords no proof
of a sudden transition from the Organic Life of one
Geological Period to the Organic Life of that which next
succeeded. We may observe, however, that the recent researches,
which have contributed so much to fill up the
interstices of the Geological Calendar, have conduced in no
small degree to fill up likewise some of the more remarkable
gaps or chasms in the succession of Organic Life. It
is, therefore, not unreasonable to suppose that, as our
knowledge of the Earth’s Crust becomes more and more
minute, the sudden breaks in the continuity of the scale
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
will be still further diminished and the successive stages of
gradual transition will be made more clearly apparent.</p>

<p>This subject has been very happily illustrated by Sir
Charles Lyell:&mdash;“To make still more clear the supposed
working of this machinery [for the deposition of Stratified
Rocks and the preservation of Organic Remains], I shall
compare it to a somewhat analogous case that might be
imagined to occur in the history of human affairs. Let the
mortality of the population of a large country represent the
successive extinction of species, and the birth of new individuals,
the introduction of new species. While these
fluctuations are gradually taking place everywhere, suppose
commissioners to be appointed to visit each province of the
country in succession, taking an exact account of the
number, names, and individual peculiarities of all the
inhabitants, and leaving in each district a register containing
a record of this information. If, after the completion
of one census, another is immediately made on the same
plan, and then another, there will, at last, be a series of
statistical documents in each province. When these belonging
to any one province are arranged in chronological order,
the contents of such as stand next to each other will differ
according to the length of time between the taking of each
census. If, for example, there are sixty provinces, and all
the registers are made in a single year, and renewed annually,
the number of births and deaths will be so small in
proportion to the whole of the inhabitants, during the interval
between the compiling of two consecutive documents,
that the individuals described in such documents will be
nearly identical; whereas, if the survey of each of the sixty
provinces occupies all the commissioners for a whole year,
so that they are unable to revisit the same place until the
expiration of sixty years, there will then be an almost entire
discordance between the persons enumerated in two consecutive
registers in the same province.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span></p>

<p>“But I must remind the reader that the case above
proposed has no pretentions to be regarded as an exact
parallel to the Geological phenomena which I desire to
illustrate; for the commissioners are supposed to visit the
different provinces in rotation; whereas the commemorating
processes by which organic remains become fossilized,
although they are always shifting from one area to the
other, are yet very irregular in their movements. They
may abandon and revisit many spaces again and again,
before they once approach another district; and besides
this source of irregularity, it may often happen that, while
the depositing process is suspended, Denudation may take
place, which may be compared to the occasional destruction
by fire or other causes of some of the statistical documents
before mentioned. It is evident that where such
accidents occur, the want of continuity in the series may
become indefinitely great, and that the monuments which
follow next in succession will by no means be equi-distant
from each other in point of time.</p>

<p>“If this train of reasoning be admitted, the occasional
distinctness of the fossil remains, in formations immediately
in contact, would be a necessary consequence of the existing
laws of sedimentary deposition and subterranean movement,
accompanied by a constant mortality and renovation
or species.”<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></p>

<p>There is another and a very striking fact in the succession
of ancient organic life, which claims from us a moment’s
notice. As we proceed upward through the series
of Stratified Rocks, from the oldest to the newest, we find
a gradual advance in the types of animal organization
therein preserved, from the humbler and more simple forms
of structure to those of a higher and more perfect character.
That form of organization is regarded among Zoologists as
the more perfect in which there is “a greater number of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
organs specially devoted to particular functions.” Now all
the forms of animal life with which we are acquainted, may
be reduced to two great divisions, the Vertebrate and the Invertebrate,&mdash;the
former having a <i>vertebral</i> or spinal column,
the latter having none: and it is agreed in conformity with
the notion set forth above, that the Vertebrate animals as a
class exhibit a more perfect organization than the Invertebrate.
Again, among the Vertebrate themselves there is a
gradation; the Reptiles are ranked higher than the Fish,
the Birds higher than the Reptiles, and the Mammalia
higher again than the Birds.</p>

<p>All this we learn from Zoologists, who have pursued their
investigations without any reference whatever to the science
of Geology. It is, therefore, not a little remarkable that we
should discover this very order and gradation of animal life in
the successive groups of Stratified Rocks. All the Remains
hitherto discovered in the earliest Geological Formations
belong to Invertebrate animals, while the Vertebrate, which
appear for the first time in the latter part of the Silurian
Period, are, from that age on, more and more fully developed
down to the present day, and now constitute, if not
the most numerous, at least the most important part of the
animal creation. Moreover, it is to be observed that the
Vertebrate animals do not all make their appearance at
once, but come in successively according to the same scale
of organic perfection,&mdash;the Fish appearing first, then the
Reptiles, then the Birds, and lastly the Mammalia. Even
among the Mammalia a well-defined order of progressive
succession has been observed, which finally culminates in
the appearance of Man, the last created and the most perfect
of animals.</p>

<div id="img_226" class="figcenter">
<p class="caption">TABLE OF GEOLOGICAL FORMATIONS,<br />

<span class="medium">SHOWING THE FIRST APPEARANCE ON THE EARTH OF THE VARIOUS FORMS
OF ANIMAL LIFE.</span></p>
<img src="images/img_226.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This remarkable succession of animal life in the history
of the Earth’s Crust will be more readily understood by
means of the annexed Table. The remains of Invertebrate
animals have been traced as far back as the Lower Laurentian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
Rocks. The Vertebrate first become manifest in the
Ludlow beds of the Upper Silurian; where they are represented
by the bones of Fish, the lowest class belonging to
the Province of Vertebrates. Next in order come the Reptiles:
the oldest known Reptile having been found in the
Coal Measures of Saarbr&uuml;ck between Strasburg and Treves.
The skeletons of Birds are rare in the Stratified Rocks. It
is supposed that their powers of flight have in all ages
secured them, to great a extent, from being carried away
by floods, like other land animals, and buried in the sedimentary
deposits of rivers and estuaries. Nevertheless their
presence in the ancient world is frequently attested by their
footsteps, impressed originally on the sandy beach, and
still preserved now that the soft sand has been converted
into solid rock. Such traces have been discovered in great
abundance on the New Red Sandstone of the Connecticut
River in America; and afford the earliest evidence we possess
in the records of Geology regarding the existence of
the feathered tribe. This group of strata belongs to the
lower Trias. In the higher beds of the same Formation we
meet with the first relic of ancient Mammals. It was found
near Stuttgardt, in 1847, and belongs to the more imperfect
form of Mammalian life, the Non-Placental. Similar
remains have been since discovered in the Upper Trias of
Somersetshire. The Placental, or more perfect form of
animal life in the same class, first appears in the Eocene
Formation: and the bones of Man, the highest of the Placental,
are found for the first time in the upper deposits of
the Post-Tertiary Age.</p>

<p>Let it be remembered that we are here but stating the
facts which have been hitherto brought to light by the
researches of Geologists. It may be, it is indeed most
probable, that new discoveries will lead to numerous modifications
in our Table. There is no reason to suppose that
Geologists have yet exhumed the earliest remains of Vertebrates
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
or Invertebrates preserved in the Crust of the Earth:
that Fish may not hereafter be traced back beyond the Silurian,
or Reptiles beyond the Carboniferous Period: that
Birds may not be found among the Primary Rocks, and
Placentals among the Secondary. But in a science which
depends mainly upon observation, it is better to register
the facts we have than to speculate idly about those we have
not. And, having registered them, we cannot fail to be
struck with the succession of animal life on the Earth, to
which they seem to point. It is certainly deserving of
notice that, as far as the Organic Remains hitherto discovered
may be taken as a guide, Invertebrates and Vertebrates,
Fish, Reptiles, Birds, and Mammals, Non-Placentals
and Placentals, follow one another in the ascending
series of Geological Formations exactly in the same order
as they follow one another in the ascending scale of Zoological
Classification.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And so Geologists go on ever searching out new phenomena,
and grouping them together into classes, until
from particular facts they lead us to general truths. Then
starting with these general truths as the groundwork of their
science, they proceed to sketch out the Natural History of
our Globe from the remotest ages of the past down to the
present time. They first study the stratified deposits of each
succeeding age, and analyze the Fossil Remains embedded
therein; afterward they make their inferences, and they
compile their history. They describe the forms, the character,
the habits, of the plants and animals that flourished
of old in this world of ours; they tell us where the deep
sea rolled its waves in each succeeding age, and where the
dry land appeared; they point out the Deltas of its ancient
rivers, they measure the breadth of its Estuaries, they
trace the course of its Glaciers, they mark the outlines of
its Mountain chains. But with these and such like speculations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
we are not here concerned. Many of them are open
to controversy, and not a few are at this moment warmly
disputed among Geologists themselves: besides, whether
true or false, they do not in any way affect the relations
between Geology and Revealed Religion. We shall be
quite content, and it is all that our present scope demands,
if we have made intelligible the general theory of Geological
Chronology, and the kind of evidence on which it rests.</p>

<p>Before taking leave of this subject, however, we will venture
to offer what seems to us an interesting illustration of
the principles we have been explaining in the last two
chapters;&mdash;one that will help to confirm the conclusions
for which we have been contending, and that will also
bring home to many minds the practical advantage to be
derived from a thorough knowledge and just application of
Geological science. Perhaps, too, it may help to revive
the flagging attention of our readers; for the subject of our
illustration is <i>Coal, and the way to find it</i>. In this age of
manufactories and steam-engines,&mdash;when the atmosphere
of great towns is heavy with smoke, and the quiet solitude
of the country is so rudely disturbed by the shrieking of the
railway-whistle and the snorting of the sooty locomotive,&mdash;this
black, dirty mineral has acquired a value and importance,
which may succeed in rousing even the practical
money-making man to pay some heed to the lessons of
science.</p>

<p>Coal might have been produced in any Geological Period;
and in point of fact, beds of coal have been discovered
in many different Formations. But in England, and
in Western Europe generally, it has been found by long
experience that the Coal-beds of the Carboniferous Formation
are more abundant, and of better quality, than those
of any other. Indeed the beds of Coal that occur in other
Formations are so thin, and of such inferior quality, that
they cannot be worked with profit. It is therefore of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
highest importance in the search for Coal, before going to
the enormous expense of sinking deep shafts, to discover
whether or no the rocks in which the search is to be made
belong to the Carboniferous Period. In this matter the
more <i>practical man</i> is often seriously at fault. Coal-bearing
strata generally consist pretty largely of dark-colored clay,
black shales, and similar deposits. This is a fact which,
as it strikes the eye, is perfectly familiar to all who are
engaged in the working of Coal mines. Hence it happens,
not unfrequently, that the practical man, when he
meets with strata of this kind, is apt at once to infer that
Coal is near at hand. The Geologist, on the contrary,
knows well that such strata are not peculiar to the Carboniferous
rocks, but are often found in other Formations in
which there is no Coal at all, or at least no Coal that will
repay the expense of working; and therefore he will pronounce
it most rash to undertake costly works on the
strength of these appearances. He has learned, however,
that there are certain species of animals and plants which
are found in the Carboniferous rocks and in them alone;
he will search for these in the strata which it is proposed
to explore, and by their presence or their absence he will
know whether the strata in question belong to the Carboniferous
Formation or not.</p>

<p>Again, it will often happen that, in the midst of an extensive
region well known to abound in Coal, the rocks which
appear at the surface in one particular locality, are not
wholly devoid of Coal, but exhibit no resemblance either
in mineral character or in Fossil Remains to the Coal-bearing
strata. A question then arises of the highest practical
importance. May it be that the Coal-bearing strata
are spread out beneath this uppermost bed of rocks? and
is it worth the expense to sink a shaft through the one in
the hope of reaching the other? The practical miner has
no very clear or certain principles to help him in the solution
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
of this problem; and thus it has often happened that
thousands upon thousands of pounds have been expended
in sinking shafts to look for Coal, where, as it afterward
proved, there was not the slightest chance of finding it.
Now, though Geology cannot tell if we shall succeed in
finding Coal beneath these rocks, it <i>can</i> tell if there is
a <i>good chance</i> of succeeding. It can tell whether there is
a reasonable hope, by penetrating into the Crust of the
Earth at this particular spot, of reaching the Carboniferous
Formation; and if we can reach the Carboniferous Formation
in the midst of a Coal district, it is very likely we shall
meet with beds of Coal.</p>

<p>His first object will be to ascertain what is the Formation
to which the superficial rocks belong. If it be a Formation
earlier in date than the Carboniferous,&mdash;the Silurian, for
instance, or the Devonian,&mdash;he knows that it would be
simply waste of money to look for Coal beneath them;
because the Carboniferous rocks cannot possibly be found
underneath the rocks of an earlier age. And so the
Geologist can tell beforehand what the mere practical man
would find out only when he had spent his money. If, on
the other hand, the rocks which appear at the surface belong
to a period later than the Carboniferous, the Geologist
will not always conclude that it is expedient to sink a shaft
in search of Coal. For though the Carboniferous rocks
may, in this case, be underneath, they may be so far down
in the Crust of the Earth that we should have no chance
of ever reaching them. Suppose, for example, that the
strata which appear at the surface belong to the Cretaceous
Formation. He knows from his Chronological table that
the Carboniferous age is separated from the Cretaceous by
three intermediate Periods,&mdash;the Permian, the Triassic, the
Jurassic. Therefore, when he finds the Cretaceous rocks
at the surface in any locality, it is quite possible, though
of course not certain, that before the Carboniferous Formation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
could be reached it would be necessary to bore through
thousands of feet of Jurassic, Triassic, and Permian rocks.
And even then there would be no certainty of meeting with
the Coal-bearing strata. Perhaps they were never deposited
over this area of the earth’s surface; or, if deposited, perhaps
they were subsequently swept away by Denudation.
Hence our Geologist would reasonably conclude that, the
probable expense of the search being so enormous, and the
chance of success so remote, it would be much wiser not
to make the attempt.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">In</span> developing the modern theory of Geology, we
have all along assumed that the Crust of the
Earth has been subject to frequent disturbances
from the earliest ages of the world. Again and again, in
the course of our argument, we have talked of the bed of
the sea being lifted up, and converted into dry land; and,
on the other hand, of the dry land being submerged beneath
the waters of the sea. We have not even hesitated to
suppose that these two opposite movements of upheaval
and submersion often took place by turns over the same
area; nay, that there is scarcely a region on the surface of
the Globe which has not been several times submerged, and
several times again upheaved.</p>

<p>Yet all this has not been taken for granted without proof.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
Our readers have seen what a long array of sober reasoning
may be drawn out to show that the Stratified Rocks have
been, for the most part, deposited <i>under water</i>:&mdash;first, from
the nature and arrangement of the materials which compose
them; secondly, from the character of the Organic Remains
they contain. And since they are now <i>above water</i>,
it is plain that either they have been lifted or the ocean has
subsided. Furthermore, if we find, as we often do, two
strata in immediate succession, the one underneath, exhibiting
the trees of an ancient forest still standing erect
with their roots attached, the other above, abounding in
the remains of aquatic animals; we must conclude that
when the ancient forest flourished this portion of the
Earth’s Crust was above the level of the sea; that afterward
it was submerged, and a new deposit, in which the marine
remains were embedded, was spread out above the earlier
vegetation; and that, last of all it again emerged from the
waters, and became once more dry land. Finally, when a
vertical section of the Earth’s Crust exhibits a continued
series of such strata alternating with each other, it affords a
proof that this particular area must have been several times
under water, and several times again dry land, in the long
course of ages.</p>

<p>These conclusions are now all but universally received
among Geologists. The Crust of the Earth, we are
assured, is not that unyielding and immovable mass which
men commonly take it to be. On the contrary, it has been
from the beginning ever restless and in motion, rising here
and subsiding there, sometimes with a convulsive shock
capable of upturning, twisting, distorting hard and stubborn
rocks as if they were but flimsy layers of pliant clay; sometimes
with a gentle, undulating movement, which, while it
uplifts islands and continents, leaves the general aspect of
the surface unchanged, the arrangement of the strata undisturbed,
and even the most tender Fossils unharmed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
Disturbances of this kind have been going on in various
parts of the world even within the period of history; and
they may be distinctly traced to the action of subterranean
Heat. In support of a theory so startling and unexpected,
Geologists appeal to the direct evidence of facts: and we
now propose to bring some of these facts under the notice
of our readers.</p>

<p>At the outset, however, it is important to set forth clearly
the doctrine we hope to illustrate and confirm. With the
origin of the internal heat that prevails within the Crust of
the Earth we have no concern. This is still an unsettled
point among Geologists themselves. Some conjecture that
our Globe, when first launched into space, was in a state of
igneous fusion; that is to say, that all the solid matter of
which it is composed was held in a molten condition by the
action of intense heat; that, in course of time, as this heat
passed off by radiation, the surface gradually cooled and
grew hard; that an external shell of solid rock was thus
formed, which has been ever growing thicker in proportion
as the Earth has been growing cooler; and that the actual
condition of our planet is the result of this process continued
down to the present day,&mdash;a fiery mass of seething
mineral within, and a comparatively thin crust of consolidated
rock without. Others suppose that the internal heat
of the Globe is developed by the agency of chemical changes
constantly going on in the depths of the Earth; and others,
again, look for a cause to the action of electricity and magnetism.
But these and such like speculations are still under
discussion, and not one of them can be regarded as anything
more, at best, than a satisfactory hypothesis. Anyhow,
it is not about the causes of internal heat that we are
just now interested, but about the fact of its existence, and
the nature of its effects. Is it true that an intense heat prevails
very generally beneath the superficial covering of the
Globe? and is that heat capable of producing those stupendous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
changes which are ascribed to it in our theory of Geology?
These are the questions to which we mean to devote
our chief attention.</p>

<p>It is a very significant fact, that <i>the deeper we penetrate into
the Crust of the Earth, the hotter it is</i>. At first, no doubt,
for a short distance, the reverse is the case. When we begin
to descend we find it cooler below than above, because the
further we depart from the surface the more we are removed
from the influence of the Sun. But at a certain point&mdash;in
our climate at about fifty feet below the surface&mdash;the influence
of the Sun’s heat ceases to be sensibly felt. When this
limit is passed, the temperature begins to rise, and thenceforth
the deeper we go the hotter the earth becomes.</p>

<p>This broad and general fact has been tested by experiments
in every part of the world, and has been found true
in all countries, in all climates, in all latitudes, whether in
coal-pits, or mines, or deep subterranean caves. “In one
and the same mine,” says Sir John Herschel,<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> “each particular
depth has its own particular degree of heat, which
never varies: but the lower always the hotter; and that not
by a trifling, but what may well be called an astonishingly
rapid rate of increase,&mdash;about a degree of the thermometer
additional warmth for every ninety feet of additional depth,<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a>
which is about 58&deg; per mile!&mdash;so that, if we had a shaft
sunk a mile deep, we should find in the rock a heat of
105&deg;, which is much hotter than the hottest summer day
ever experienced in England.” Now if the temperature
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
continue to increase at this rate toward the centre of the
Earth, it is quite certain that, at no very great distance from
the surface, the heat would be sufficiently intense to reduce
the hardest granite and the most refractory metals to a state
of igneous fusion.</p>

<p>Again, every one is familiar with the existence of hot
springs, which come up from unknown depths in the
Earth’s Crust, and which, appearing as they do in almost
all parts of the world, testify in unmistakable language to
the existence of internal heat. At Bath, for instance, in
England, the water comes up from the bowels of the Earth,
at a temperature of 117&deg; Fahrenheit; and in the United
States, on the Arkansas River, there is a spring at 180&deg;&mdash;not
much below the boiling point. This remarkable phenomenon,
however, may be more closely investigated in the
case of Artesian Wells, so called from the province of Artois,
in France, where they first came into use. These wells are
formed artificially, by boring down through the superficial
strata of the Earth, sometimes to enormous depths, until
water is reached. It has been found in every case that the
water coming up from these great depths is always hot; and,
furthermore, that the deeper the boring the hotter the water.
A well of this kind was sunk in 1834 at Grenelle, in the
suburbs of Paris, to a depth of more than 1800 English
feet, and the water, which rushed up with surprising force,
had a temperature of 82&deg; Fahrenheit; whereas the mean
temperature of the air in the cellars of the Paris Observatory
is only 53&deg;. The water has ever since continued to flow,
and the temperature has never varied. At Salzwerth, in
Germany, where the boring is still deeper, being 2,144 feet,
the water which rises to the surface is 91&deg; of our scale.</p>

<p>Then we have, in many countries, jets of steam which
issue at a high temperature from crevices in the Earth, and
which tell of the existence of heated water below, as plainly
as the steam that escapes from the funnel of a locomotive or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
from the spout of a tea-kettle. Phenomena of this kind are
very common in Italy, where they are sometimes exhibited
at intervals along a line of country twenty miles in length.
But in Iceland it is that they are displayed in the highest
degree of splendor and power. On the southwest side of
that island, within a circuit of two miles, there are nearly a
hundred hot springs called Geysers, from some of which,
at intervals, immense volumes of steam and boiling water
are violently projected into the air. The Great Geyser is a
natural tube, ten feet wide, descending into the Earth to a
depth of seventy feet, and opening out above into a broad
basin, from fifty to sixty feet in diameter. This basin, as
well as the tube which connects it with the interior of the
Earth, is lined with a beautifully smooth and hard plaster
of siliceous cement, and is generally filled to the brim with
water of a clear azure color, and a temperature little below
boiling point. The ordinary condition of the spring is one
of comparative repose, the water rising slowly in the tube
and trickling over the edge of the stony basin. But every
few hours an eruption takes place. Subterranean explosions
are first heard, like the firing of distant cannon; then a violent
ebullition follows, clouds of steam are given out, and
jets of boiling water are cast up into the air. After a little
the disturbance ceases, and all is quiet again. Once a day,
or thereabouts, these phenomena are exhibited on a scale
of extraordinary grandeur: the explosions which announce
beforehand the approaching display are more numerous and
violent than usual; then such volumes of steam rush forth
as to obscure the atmosphere for half a mile around; and,
finally, a vast column of water is projected to a height of
from one to two hundred feet, and continues for a quarter
of an hour to play like an artificial fountain. Geysers
scarcely less grand and striking are to be seen in New Zealand,
from which the water is thrown up at a temperature
214&deg; Fahrenheit, or two degrees above boiling point.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span></p>

<p>Such are the evident symptoms of subterranean heat,&mdash;hot
springs, jets of steam, fountains of boiling water,&mdash;which
are manifested unceasingly at the surface of the Earth
in every quarter of the Globe. But it is sometimes given
us to behold, as it were, the subterranean fire itself, and to
contemplate its power under a more striking and awful
form. From time to time, in the fury of its rage, the fiery
element bursts asunder the prison-house in which it is confined,
and rushes forth into the light of day; then flames
are seen to issue from the surface of the Earth, yawning
chasms begin to appear on every side, the roaring of the
furnaces is heard in the depths below, clouds of red-hot
cinders are ejected high into the air, and streams of incandescent
liquid rock are poured forth from every crevice,
which, rolling far away through smiling fields and
peaceful villages, carry destruction and desolation in their
track. These are the ordinary phenomena of an active
volcano during the period of eruption; and even while we
write, most of them may be witnessed actually taking place
for the hundredth time, on the historic ground of Mount
Vesuvius. Our typical example, however, we shall take
from the eruption of that mountain in the year 1779. It
was not, indeed, especially remarkable for its violence or
for the catastrophes by which it was attended; but it had
the good fortune to be accurately recorded by an eye-witness,
Sir William Hamilton, who, at that time, represented
the English Government at the Court of Naples;
and we are thus more minutely acquainted with all its
various circumstances than with those of any other eruption
of equal importance.</p>

<p>For two years before, the mountain had been in a state
of excitement and disturbance. From time to time rumbling
noises were heard underground, dense masses of
smoke were emitted from the crater, liquid lava at a white
heat bubbled up from crevices on the slopes of the mountain,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
and through these crevices a glimpse could be had
here and there of the rocky caverns within, all “red-hot
like a heated oven.” But in the month of August, 1779,
the eruption reached its climax. About nine o’clock in
the evening of Sunday the eighth, according to the graphic
description of Sir William Hamilton, “there was a loud
report, which shook the houses at Portici and its neighborhood
to such a degree as to alarm the inhabitants and drive
them out into the streets. Many windows were broken, and,
as I have since seen, walls cracked, from the concussion of
the air from that explosion. In one instant, a fountain of
liquid transparent fire began to rise, and, gradually increasing,
arrived at so amazing a height, as to strike every one
who beheld it with the most awful astonishment. I shall
scarcely be credited when I assure you that, to the best of
my judgment, the height of this stupendous column of fire
could not be less than three times that of Vesuvius itself,
which, you know, rises perpendicularly near 3,700 feet
above the level of the sea. Puffs of smoke, as black as
can possibly be imagined, succeeded one another hastily,
and accompanied the red-hot, transparent, and liquid lava,
interrupting its splendid brightness here and there by
patches of the darkest hue. Within these puffs of smoke,
at the very moment of their emission from the crater, I
could perceive a bright but pale electrical light playing
about in zigzag lines. The liquid lava, mixed with scoriae
and stones, after having mounted, I verily believe, at least
10,000 feet, falling perpendicularly on Vesuvius, covered its
whole cone, and part of that of Somma, and the valley between
them. The falling matter being nearly as vivid and
inflamed as that which was continually issuing fresh from
the crater, formed with it a complete body of fire, which
could not be less than two miles and a half in breadth, and
of the extraordinary height above mentioned, casting a
heat to the distance of at least six miles around it. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
brushwood of the mountain of Somma was soon in a flame,
which, being of a different tint from the deep red of the
matter thrown out from the Volcano, and from the silvery
blue of the electrical fire, still added to the contrast of this
most extraordinary scene. After the column of fire continued
in full force for nearly half an hour the eruption
ceased at once, and Vesuvius remained sullen and silent.”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></p>

<p>The existence, then, of intense heat within the Crust of
the Earth may be regarded as an established fact where-ever
an active Volcano appears at the surface. Now let us
consider for a moment, the very extensive scale on which
these fiery engines of Nature are distributed over the face of
the Globe. First, on the great continent of America.
The whole chain of the Andes&mdash;that stupendous ridge of
mountains which stretches along the western coast of South
America, from Tierra del Fuego on the south to the isthmus
of Panama on the north&mdash;is studded over with Volcanos,
most of which have been seen in active eruption
within the last 300 years. Passing the narrow isthmus of
Panama, this line of Volcanos may still be traced through
Guatemala to Mexico, and thence northward even as far as
the mouth of the Columbia River. Here is a vast volcanic
region extending fully 6,000 miles in length, and spreading
out its fiery arms, we know not how far, to the right
and to the left. At Quito, just on the Equator, a branch
shoots off toward the northeast, and, passing through New
Granada and Venezuela, stretches away across the West
India Islands, taking in St. Vincent, Dominica, Guadaloupe,
and many others; while, in the opposite direction,
it is certain that the volcanic action extends westward, far
away beneath the waters of the Pacific, though we have no
definite means of ascertaining where its influence ceases to
be felt.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span></p>

<p>Another vast train of active Volcanos is that which skirts
the eastern and southern coasts of Asia. Commencing on
the shores of Northwestern America, it passes through the
Aleutian Islands to Kamtschatka; then, in a sort of undulating
curve, it winds its course by the Kurile Islands, the
Japanese group, the Philippines, and the northeastern extremity
of the Celebes, to the Moluccas. At this point it
divides into two branches; one going in a southeasterly
direction to New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, the Friendly
Islands, and New Zealand; the other pursuing a northwesterly
course through Java and Sumatra into the Bay of
Bengal.</p>

<p>There is a third great line of volcanic fires which has
been pretty well traced out by modern travellers, extending
through China and Tartary to the Caucasus; thence over
the countries bordering the Black Sea to the Grecian Archipelago;
then on to Naples, Sicily, the Lipari Islands, the
southern part of Spain and Portugal, and the Azores.
Besides these there are numerous groups of Volcanos not
apparently linked on to any regular volcanic chain, nor
reduced as yet by scientific men to any general system;
Mount Hecla, for instance, in Iceland, the Mountains of
the Moon in Central Africa, Owhyhee in the Sandwich
Islands, and many others rising up irregularly from the
broad waters of the Pacific.</p>

<p>From this brief outline some idea may be formed of the
magnificent scale on which volcanic agency is developed
within the Crust of the Earth. It must be remembered,
however, that any estimate based upon the enumeration we
have given, would be, in all probability, far below the
truth; for we have mentioned those Volcanos only which
have attracted the notice of scientific men, or which have
chanced to fall under the observation of travellers. Many
others, doubtless, must exist in regions not yet explored,
and in the profound depths of the seas and oceans, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
cover nearly two-thirds of the area of our planet. Moreover,
we have said nothing at all of <i>extinct</i> Volcanos&mdash;such
as those of Auvergne in France, and of the Rocky Mountains
in America&mdash;which have not been in active operation
within historical times; but in which, nevertheless, the
hardened streams of lava, the volcanic ashes, and the cone-shaped
mountains terminating in hollow craters, tell the
story of eruptions in bygone ages, not less clearly than the
blackened walls and charred timbers of some stately building
bear witness to the passing wayfarer of a long extinguished
conflagration.</p>

<p>We contend, therefore, that the doctrine of intense subterranean
heat is not a wild conjecture, but is based on a
solid groundwork of facts. First, there is presumptive
evidence. In every deep mine, in every deep sinking of
whatever kind, the heat of the earth increases rapidly as we
descend. Hot water comes from great depths, and never
cold. Sometimes it is boiling: sometimes it has been converted
into steam. All this is found to be the case universally,
whenever an opportunity has occurred for making
the trial; and it seems to afford a strong presumption that
if one could go still deeper, the heat would be found yet
more intense, and would at length be capable of reducing
to a liquid state the solid materials of which the earth is
composed. Next, there is the direct testimony of our senses.
A channel is opened from the depths below, flames are
seen, red-hot cinders are cast up, and molten rock is
poured out over the surface of the Earth in a liquid stream
of fire. This evidence, however, though direct and conclusive
as far as it goes, is not universal. It proves that an
intense white heat prevails within the Crust of the Earth,
not everywhere, but at least in those numerous and extensive
regions where active Volcanos exist. So stands the
case, as it seems to us, for the doctrine of subterranean heat
as far as regards the fact of its existence.

<img class="drop-cap" src="images/h.jpg" alt="H" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Having</span> now sufficiently demonstrated the existence
of intense subterranean heat, diffused, if not universally,
at least very generally, beneath the superficial
shell of the Earth, we shall next proceed to inquire
if it is capable of effecting those physical changes which
are ascribed to it in Geology;&mdash;of producing land where
none before existed, of upheaving the solid Crust of the
Earth, of driving the ocean from its bed, of dislocating
and contorting solid masses of rock. The argument is still
an appeal to facts. Such effects as these have been produced
by the agency of internal heat, under actual observation,
in the present age of the world; and it is not unreasonable
to attribute to the same cause similar phenomena
in ages gone by.</p>

<p>We will not run the risk of dissipating the force of this
reasoning by attempting to expand it. It will be enough
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
for us to state the facts: we shall leave it to our readers to
estimate for themselves the value of the argument. There
are three forms, more or less distinct, though closely associated,
under which the subterranean fires have exerted
their power in modern times to disturb and modify
the Physical Geography of the Globe;&mdash;(1) the Volcano,
(2) the Earthquake, (3) the gentle Undulation of the
Earth’s Crust. Of these we shall speak in order.</p>

<p>In the case of Volcanos, as we have already sufficiently
conveyed, the hidden furnaces of the Earth find a vent for
their surplus energies; and when this vent is once established,
that is to say, when the active Volcano has begun
to exist, it seems probable that there is little further
upheaval, properly so called, of the surface. Nevertheless,
Volcanos contribute largely to the formation of land by the
vast accumulation of ashes, mud, and lava, which they
vomit forth. The destruction of Herculaneum and Pompeii
is a case in point. For eight days successively, in the
year 79, the ashes and pumice stone cast up from the crater
of Vesuvius, fell down in one unceasing shower upon
these devoted cities; while at the same time floods of water,
carrying along the fine dust and light cinders, swept down
the sides of the mountain in resistless torrents of mud, entering
the houses, penetrating into every nook and crevice, and
filling even the very wine jars in the underground cellars.</p>

<p>At the present moment the layers of volcanic matter
beneath which Pompeii has been slumbering for centuries,
are from twelve to fourteen feet over the tops of the houses.
Loftier still is the pile that overlies the buried Herculaneum.
This city, situated nearer to the base of the Volcano,
has been exposed to the effects of many successive
eruptions; and accordingly, spread out over the mass of
ashes and pumice by which it was first overwhelmed, in the
time of Pliny, we now find alternate layers of lava and volcanic
mud, together with fresh accumulations of ashes, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
a height, in many places, of 112 feet, and nowhere less
than 70. Nor was this ejected matter confined to these
two populous towns. It was scattered far and wide over
the country around, and has contributed in no small degree
to that extraordinary richness and fertility for which the
soil of Naples is so justly famed.</p>

<p>As regards the production of land where none before
existed, here is one fact of singular significance. At
the time of the eruption, in 79, Pompeii was a seaport
town to which merchantmen were wont to resort, and a
flight of steps, which still remains, led down to the water’s
edge: it is now more than a mile distant from the coast,
and the tract of land which intervenes is composed entirely
of volcanic tuff and ashes.</p>

<p>Gladly would we linger over the reminiscences of these
luxurious and ill-fated cities. By the removal of the ashes,
Pompeii is now laid open to view for at least one-third of its
extent; and a strange sight it is, this ancient Roman city
thus risen as it were from the grave,&mdash;risen, but yet lifeless,&mdash;with
its silent streets, and its tenantless houses, and its
empty Forum. Wherever we turn we have before us a
curious and interesting picture, ghastly though it is, of the
social, political, and domestic life of those ancient times,
of the glory and the shame that hung around the last days
of Pagan Rome;&mdash;in the theatres and the temples, in the
shops and the private houses, in the graceful frescoes, in the
elaborate mosaics, and, not least, in the idle scribblings
on the walls, which, with a sort of whimsical reverence,
have been spared by the destroying hand of Time. Then
again, what a host of singular relics are there to be wondered
at:&mdash;articles of domestic use and luxury, kitchen
utensils and surgical instruments; female skeletons with
the ornaments and vanities of the world, rings and bracelets
and necklaces, still clinging to their charred remains; and
strangest perhaps of all, eighty-four loaves of bread, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
were put into the oven to bake 1800 years ago, and were
taken out only yesterday, with the baker’s brand upon them,
and the stamp of the baker’s elbow still freshly preserved in
the centre of each. No subject could be more tempting to
a writer, none more attractive to a reader. But our present
purpose is to show the effects of Volcanos in elevating
the level of the land; and so we must turn our back on
the buried cities, and crossing the Bay of Naples, seek for
a new illustration in the formation of Monte Nuovo, a lofty
hill overlooking the ancient town of Pozzuoli.</p>

<p>About one o’clock at night, on Sunday, the twenty-ninth
of September, 1538, flames were seen to issue from the
ground close to the waters of the beautiful bay of Baiae.
After a little, a sound like thunder was heard, the earth was
rent asunder, and through the rent large stones, red-hot
cinders, volcanic mud and volumes of water, were furiously
vomited forth, which covered the whole country around,
reaching even as far as Naples, and disfiguring its palaces
and public buildings. The next morning it was found that
a new mountain had been formed by the accumulation of
ejected matter around the central opening. This mountain
remains to the present day, and is called the Monte
Nuovo. In form it is a regular volcanic cone, four hundred
and forty feet high, and a mile and a half in circumference
at its base, with an open crater in the centre, which
descends nearly to the level of the sea. An eye-witness
who has left us a minute account of this eruption, relates
that on the third day he went up with many people to the
top of the new hill, and looking down into the crater, saw
the stones that had fallen to the bottom, “boiling up just
as a caldron of water boils on the fire.” The same writer
informs us&mdash;and it is very much to our present purpose to
note the fact&mdash;that immediately before the eruption began,
the relative position of land and sea was materially changed,
the coast was sensibly upraised, the waters retired about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
two hundred paces, and multitudes of fish were raised high
and dry upon the sand, a prey to the inhabitants of Pozzuoli.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<p>The Monte Nuovo is but a type of its class. If we
travel westward 8,000 miles from Naples to the more stupendous
Volcanos of the New World, we may witness the
same phenomena on a still grander scale. In the province
of Mexico, there is an elevated and extensive plain
called Malpais, where for many generations the cotton
plant, the indigo, and the sugar-cane, flourished luxuriantly
in a soil richly endowed with natural gifts, and carefully
cultivated by its industrious inhabitants. Everything
was going on as usual in this smiling and prosperous region,
and no one dreamed of danger, when suddenly, in
the month of June, 1759, subterranean sounds were heard,
attended with slight convulsions of the earth. These symptoms
of internal commotion continued until the month of
September, when they gradually died away, and tranquillity
seemed to be restored. But it was only the delusive lull that
precedes the fury of the storm. On the night of the twenty-eighth
of September the rumbling sounds were heard again
more violent than before. The inhabitants fled in consternation
to a neighboring mountain, from the summit of which
they looked back with wonder and dismay upon the utter
annihilation of their homesteads and their farms. Flames
broke out over an area half a square league in extent, the
earth was burst open in many places, fragments of burning
rock were thrown to prodigious heights in the air, torrents
of boiling mud flowed over the plain, and thousands of
little conical hills, called by the natives Hornitos or Ovens,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
rose up from the surface of the land. Finally a vast chasm
was opened, and such quantities of ashes and fragmentary
lava were ejected as to raise up six great mountain masses,
which continued to increase during the five months that
the eruption lasted. The least of these is 300 feet high, and
the central one, now called Jorullo, which is still burning,
is 1600 feet above the level of the plain. When Baron
Humboldt visited this region just forty years after the eruption
had ceased, the ground was still intensely hot, and “the
Hornitos were pouring forth columns of steam twenty or
thirty feet high, with a rumbling noise like that of a steam
boiler.”<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> Since that time, however, the face of the country
has become once more smiling and prosperous; the
slopes of the newly-formed hills are now clothed with vegetation,
and the sugar-cane and the indigo again flourish
luxuriantly in the fertile plains below.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the Globe, 10,000 miles from
Mexico, we have had, almost in our own time, an exhibition
of volcanic phenomena not less wonderful than those
we have been describing. The island of Sumbawa lies
about two hundred miles to the east of Java in the Indian
Archipelago; and it belongs to that remarkable chain of
Volcanos which we have already described as stretching,
with little interruption, along the coast of Asia from Russian
America to the Bay of Bengal. In the year 1815, this
island was the scene of a calamitous eruption, the effects
of which were felt over the whole of the Molucca Islands
and Java, as well as over a considerable portion of Celebes,
Sumatra, and Borneo. Indeed, so extraordinary are the incidents
of this eruption, that we might well hesitate to believe
them if they had not been collected on the spot with more
than ordinary diligence, and recorded with an almost scrupulous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
care. Sir Stamford Raffles, who was at the time
governor of Java, then a British possession, required all the
residents in the various districts under his authority to send
in a statement of the circumstances which occurred within
their own knowledge; and from the accounts he received
in this way, combined with other evidence, chiefly obtained
from eye-witnesses, he drew up the narrative to which we
are mainly indebted for the following facts.</p>

<p>The explosions which accompanied this eruption were
heard in Sumatra, at a distance of 970 geographical miles;
and in the opposite direction at Ternate, a distance of 720
miles. In the neighborhood of the Volcano itself, immense
tracts of land were covered with burning lava, towns
and villages were overwhelmed, all kinds of vegetation completely
destroyed, and of 12,000 inhabitants in the province
of Tomboro, only twenty-six survived. The ashes, which
were ejected in great quantities, were carried like a vast
cloud through the air, by the southeast monsoon, for 300
miles in the direction of Java; and, still farther to the west,
we are told that they formed a floating mass in the ocean
two feet thick and several miles in extent, through which
ships with difficulty forced their way. It is recorded, too,
that they fell so thick on the island of Tombock, 100 miles
away, as to cover all the land two feet deep, destroying
every particle of vegetation, insomuch that 44,000 people
perished of the famine that ensued. “I have seen it computed,”
writes Sir John Herschel, “that the quantity of
ashes and lava vomited forth in this awful eruption would
have formed three mountains the size of Mont Blanc, the
highest of the Alps; and if spread over the surface of Germany,
would have covered the whole of it two feet deep.”
Finally, it appears that this eruption was accompanied, like
that of Monte Nuovo, by a permanent change in the level
of the adjoining coast; in this case, however, it was a
movement, not of upheaval, but of subsidence: the town
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
of Tomboro sunk beneath the ocean, which is now eighteen
feet deep where there was dry land before.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></p>

<p>Once more we will ask our readers to take a rapid flight
over the map of the world, passing, this time, from the Indian
Archipelago to the island of Iceland,&mdash;that “wonderful
land of frost and fire.” Besides the famous Volcano of
Hecla, there are five others scarcely less formidable, all of
which have been in active eruption within modern times.
Of these the most celebrated is that of Skaptar Jokul. In
the year 1783, this Volcano poured forth two streams of lava,
which, when hardened, formed together one continuous
layer of igneous rock, ninety miles in length, a hundred
feet in height, and from seven to fifteen miles in breadth.
The phenomena which accompanied the eruption are
thus vividly described by Sir John Herschel:&mdash;“On the tenth
of May innumerable fountains of fire were seen shooting
up through the ice and snow which covered the mountain;
and the principal river, called the Skapta, after rolling
down a flood of foul and poisonous water, disappeared.
Two days after, a torrent of lava poured down into the bed
which the river had deserted. The river had run in a
ravine 600 feet deep and 200 broad. This the lava entirely
filled; and not only so, but it overflowed the surrounding
country, and ran into a great lake, from which it instantly
expelled the water in an explosion of steam. When the
lake was fairly filled, the lava again overflowed and divided
into two streams, one of which covered some ancient lava
fields; the other re-entered the bed of the Skapta lower
down, and presented the astounding sight of a cataract of
liquid fire pouring over what was formerly the waterfall of
Stapafoss. This was the greatest eruption on record in
Europe. It lasted in its violence till the end of August,
and closed with a violent earthquake; but for nearly the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
whole year a canopy of cinder-laden cloud hung over the
island: the Faroe Islands, nay, even Shetland and the
Orkneys, were deluged with ashes; and volcanic dust and
a preternatural smoke which obscured the sun, covered all
Europe as far as the Alps, over which it could not rise.
The destruction of life in Iceland was frightful: 9,000 men,
11,000 cattle, 28,000 horses, and 190,000 sheep perished;
mostly by suffocation. The lava ejected has been computed
to amount in volume to more than twenty cubic
miles.”<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p>

<p>With these very significant facts before us, it is hard to
resist the conclusion that the great mountain mass of Etna,
11,000 feet high and ninety miles in circumference, is
formed entirely of volcanic matter ejected during successive
eruptions. For the whole mountain is nothing else than
a series of concentric conical layers of ashes and lava, such
as have been poured out more than once upon its existing
surface in modern times. Just, then, as Monte Nuovo
was produced by an outburst of volcanic power in a single
night, and the far larger mountain of Jorullo in the course of
a few months, so may we believe that the more stupendous
Etna is the work of the same power operating through a
period of many centuries. And applying this conclusion
to many other mountains throughout the world of exactly
the same structure, we come to form no very mean estimate
of the permanent changes wrought on the physical geography
of our Globe by the operations of volcanic agency.</p>

<p>We must remember, too, that volcanic eruptions are not
confined to the land; they often break out in the bed of the
sea. In such cases the waters are observed in a state of
violent commotion, jets of steam and sulphurous vapor are
emitted, light scoriaceous matter appears floating on the
surface, and not unfrequently the volcanic cone itself
slowly rises from the depths below, and continues to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
grow from day to day, until at length it becomes an island
of no inconsiderable magnitude. Sometimes when the
violence of the eruption has subsided, the new island, consisting
chiefly of ashes and pumice-stone, is gradually
washed away by the action of the waves; but in the other
cases, these lighter substances are compacted together by
the injection of liquid lava, and being thus able to withstand
the erosive power of the ocean, assume the importance
of permanent volcanic islands. Many examples of
the former kind are recorded within the last hundred years.
In 1783 an island was thrown up in the North Atlantic
Ocean, about thirty miles to the southwest of Iceland. It
was claimed by the King of Denmark, and called by him
Ny&ouml;e or New Island; but before a year had elapsed, this
portion of his Majesty’s dominion disappeared again beneath
the waves, and the sea resumed its ancient domain.
A cone-shaped island of the same kind, called Sabrina,
three hundred feet high, with a crater in the centre, appeared
amongst the Azores in 1811, but was quickly
washed away again.</p>

<p>A more interesting example, because the circumstances
are more minutely recorded, is the island which made its
appearance in the Mediterranean, off the southwest coast of
Sicily, in the year 1831. During its brief existence of three
months, it received from contemporary writers seven different
names; but the name of Graham Island seems to be
the one by which it is most likely to be known to posterity.
“About the tenth of July,” writes Sir Charles Lyell, “John
Corrao, the captain of a Sicilian vessel, reported that, as he
passed near the place, he saw a column of water like a
waterspout, sixty feet high, and eight hundred yards in circumference,
rising from the sea, and soon afterward a
dense steam in its place, which ascended to the height of
1800 feet. The same Corrao, on his return from Girgenti,
on the eighteenth of July, found a small island, twelve feet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
high, with a crater in the centre, ejecting volcanic matter
and immense columns of vapor; the sea around being
covered with floating cinders and dead fish. The scoriae
were of a chocolate color, and the water, which boiled in
the circular basin, was of a dingy red. The eruption continued
with great violence to the end of the same month,
at which time the island was visited by several persons, and
amongst others by Captain Swinburne, R. N., and M. Hoffman,
the Prussian Geologist.”<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> By the fourth of August
the new island is said to have attained a height of 200 feet,
and to have been three miles in circumference. Yet this
was nothing more than the top of the volcanic cone; for, a
few years before, Captain W. H. Smyth, in his survey, had
found a depth of 600 feet at this very spot; and therefore
the total height from the base of the mountain must have
been 800 feet. From the beginning of August it began to
melt away; and at the commencement of the following
year, nothing remained of Graham Island but a dangerous
shoal.</p>

<p>But even of the islands that occupy a prominent place
on the map of the world, there is not wanting evidence to
show that a large number derive their origin from the
action of volcanic power. Among these may be mentioned
many of the Molucca and Philippine groups, also several
in the Grecian Archipelago, and not a few of the Azores
and the Canaries,&mdash;in particular the lofty peak of Teneriffe,
rising 12,000 feet above the level of the sea. In some
cases, indeed, the actual process of their birth, and of their
subsequent growth and development, has been minutely
observed. A remarkable example occurs among the Aleutian
Islands already referred to. In the year 1796 a column
of smoke was seen to issue from the sea; then a small
black point appeared at the surface of the water; then
flames broke out, and other volcanic phenomena were exhibited;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
then the small black point grew into an island,
and the island increased in size until it was at last several
thousand feet high, and two or three miles in circumference.
And such it remains to the present day.</p>

<p>The neighborhood of Santorin in the Grecian Archipelago
has been noted from very remote times as the
theatre of submarine eruptions. This island, which is
itself to all appearance the crater of a vast volcano, has the
form of a crescent, and, with the aid of two smaller islands
which stretch across between the horns of the crescent, encloses
an almost circular bay. We learn from Pliny that
in the year 186 before Christ, within this bay an island rose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
up which was called Hiera or the Sacred island. It was
twice enlarged during the Christian era, once in 726, and
again in 1427, and still exists under the name of Palaia
Kaimeni, that is to say, the Old Burnt Island. In 1573 a
second island made its appearance, and received the name
of the Little Burnt Island, Mikra Kaimeni. In 1707 and
1709, a third island was thrown up, and was distinguished
from the other two as Nea Kaimeni, the New Burnt Island.
Lastly, in 1866 the hidden volcanic power again became
active, and two new vents were formed, called respectively
Aphroessa and George. “At the end of January,” writes
Sir Charles Lyell, “the sea had been observed in a state of
ebullition off the southwest coast, and part of the Channel
between New and Old Kaimeni, marked seventy fathoms
in the Admiralty chart, had become, on February the
eleventh, only twelve fathoms deep. According to M.
Julius Schmidt, a gradual rising of the bottom went on
until a small island made its appearance called afterward
Aphroessa. It seems to have consisted of lava pressed upward
and outward almost imperceptibly by steam, which
was escaping at every pore through the hissing scoriaceous
crust. ‘It could be seen,’ says Commander Lindesay Brine,
R. N., ‘through the fissures in the cone that the rocks
within were red hot, but it was not till later that an eruption
began.’ On February the eleventh the village of Vulcano
on the southeast coast, where there had been a partial
sinking of the ground, was in great part overwhelmed
by the materials cast out from a new vent which opened in
that neighborhood, and to which the name of George was
given, which finally, according to Schmidt, became about
two hundred feet high.</p>

<p>“Commander Brine having ascended on February the
twenty-eighth, 1866, to the top of the crater of Nea Kaimeni,
about three hundred and fifty feet high, looked down
upon the new vent then in full activity. The whole of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
cone was swaying with an undulating motion to the right
and left, and appeared sometimes to swell to nearly double
its size and height, to throw out ridges like mountain spurs,
till at last a broad chasm appeared across the top of the
cone, accompanied by a tremendous roar of steam and the
shooting up from the new crater, to the height of from
fifty to a hundred feet, of tons of rock and ash mixed with
smoke and steam. Some of these which fell on Mikra
Kaimeni, at a distance of six hundred yards from the
crater, measured thirty cubic feet. This effort over, the
ridges slowly subsided, the cone lowered and closed in, and
then, after a few minutes of comparative silence, the struggle
would begin again with precisely similar sounds, action,
and result. Threads of vapor escaping from the old crater
of Nea Kaimeni proved that there was a subterranean connection
between the new and the old vents. Aphroessa,
of which the cone was at length raised to a height of more
than sixty feet, was united in August with the main island.
This was due in part at least to the upheaval of the bottom
of the sea, which is now only seven fathoms deep in the
channel dividing the New and Old Kaimenis, whereas
in the Admiralty chart the soundings gave a hundred
fathoms.”<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span> chief effect of volcanic eruptions on the Geological
structure of our Globe consists in the
accumulation of cinders and molten rock, either
upon the Surface of the Earth, or in the crevices and caverns
that abound within its solid Crust. Sometimes, indeed,
the operations of an active Volcano are accompanied by a
movement of upheaval or of subsidence. Thus for instance,
we have seen that a portion of the Italian coast was elevated
when Monte Nuovo was thrown up, that the town of Tomboro
was submerged on the occasion of the eruption of
Sumbawa, and that the bottom of the sea was notably upheaved
by the last outbreak of the volcanic fires of Santorini.
Nevertheless it appears to be generally the case that when
the Crust of the Earth is once burst open, and a means of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
escape thus afforded to the fiery agent below,&mdash;in other
words, when the active volcano is established,&mdash;the process
of upheaval gives place to that of eruption. But when,
as is often the case, no such safety-valve is offered to the surplus
energies of the subterranean fires, then the giant power
of heat, in its struggle to escape, shakes the foundation of
the hills, and uplifts the superincumbent mass of solid rocks.</p>

<p>This theory which ascribes the phenomena of Earthquakes
and Volcanos to the same common cause, acting
under different circumstances, is now almost universally
adopted by Geologists; and it may be briefly enforced by
the following considerations. First, though Earthquakes
have sometimes occurred far away from any known volcanic
region, yet they are more frequent in the neighborhood of
active or extinct Volcanos. Secondly, almost all volcanic
eruptions are preceded by Earthquakes; and the Earthquakes
generally cease, or, at least become less violent,
when the subterranean fire breaks out in the form of a Volcano.
And, Thirdly, it is plain that the condensed steam
which is generated by internal heat, and the expansive
power of the heat itself, must, of necessity, when pent up
in the caverns of the Earth, tend to produce those very
phenomena by which Earthquakes are distinguished.</p>

<p>Let it be observed, however, that while we explain the
phenomena in question by the agency of subterranean heat,
this doctrine is by no means necessary for the main purpose
of our present argument. Whatever may be the cause
from which the Earthquake shock proceeds, it is enough
for us to show that the Crust of the Earth has been from
time to time upraised, and dislocated, and rent asunder in
modern times, just as it is supposed in Geological theory,
to have been upraised, and dislocated, and rent asunder
from time to time in by-gone ages. We will set down a
few out of the many examples observed and recorded during
the last hundred and twenty years.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span></p>

<p>When the English colonists settled in New Zealand,
about fifty years ago, they were told by the natives that they
might expect a great Earthquake every seven years. This
alarming prediction has not been literally fulfilled; but it
is fully admitted that the total number of such disturbances
within the last half century has not fallen short of what it
should have been according to the above estimate. During
the years 1826 and 1827 several shocks were felt in the
neighborhood of Cook Strait, after which it was observed
that the sea-shore had been uplifted on the north side of
Dusky Bay. So transformed was the outline of the coast
that its former features could no longer be recognized; and
a small cove called the Jail, which had previously afforded
a commodious harbor to vessels, engaged in seal fishing,
was completely dried up.</p>

<p>But the most memorable convulsion took place on the
night of January the twenty-third, 1855. A tract of land,
about as large as Yorkshire, on the southwest coast of the
North Island, was permanently upraised from one to nine
feet. The harbor of Port Nicholson, together with the
valley of the Hutt, was elevated four to five feet; and a
sunken rock, regarded before as dangerous to navigators,
has remained since the Earthquake three feet above the
level of the water. The shock was felt by ships at sea a
hundred and fifty miles from the coast; and it is estimated
that the whole area affected was not less than three times
the extent of the British Islands.</p>

<p>The whole coast of Chili has been subject to great disturbances
and changes of level during the present century.
In November, 1837, the town of Valdivia was destroyed by
an Earthquake, and at the same moment, a whaling vessel,
a short distance out at sea, was violently shaken, and lost
her masts. The bottom of the sea was afterward found to
have been raised in some places more than eight feet; and
several rocks appeared high above the water which had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
previously been covered at all times by the sea. Two years
before, in 1835, the town of Conception and several others
were reduced to ruins by a like visitation. After the first
great convulsion the Earth remained for many days in a
state of commotion. More than three hundred lesser shocks
were counted from the twentieth of February to the fourth
of March. On this occasion, too, the bed of the sea was
upheaved; and the whole island of Santa Maria, seven
miles in length, was lifted up from eight to ten feet above
its former level.</p>

<p>The Earthquake of 1822 was more violent, perhaps, and
more striking in its effects, than either of those just mentioned.
On the nineteenth of November in that year a
sudden convulsive shock was simultaneously felt over a
space 1200 miles in length. At Valparaiso, and on either
side for a considerable distance, the coast was permanently
upheaved. When Mrs. Graham, who was then living on
the spot, and who has left us an account of the Earthquake,
went down to the shore on the following day, she “found
the ancient bed of the sea laid bare and dry, with beds of
oysters, mussels, and other shells adhering to the rocks on
which they grew, the fish being all dead, and exhaling most
offensive effluvia.” Some idea may be formed of the
gigantic power here in operation, when it is remembered
that to uplift the coast of Chili, it was necessary to move
the mighty chain of the Andes, and, amongst the rest, the
colossal mass of Aconcagua, 24,000 feet in height. How
far this process of upheaval extended out to sea, beneath
the bed of the ocean, has not been accurately ascertained:
but certain it is that, for a considerable distance, the soundings
were found to be shallower than before the Earthquake.
It is roughly estimated that the Crust of the Earth was
elevated over an extent of 100,000 square miles, or about
half the area of France.</p>

<p>On the western coast of India, near the mouth of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
river Indus, is the well-known district of Cutch. In the
month of June, 1819, this extensive territory, not less than
half the size of Ireland, was violently shaken by an Earthquake,
several hundred people were killed, and many towns
and villages were laid in ruins. The shocks continued for
some days, and ceased only when the outburst of a Volcano
seemed to open a vent for the troubled spirit within.
But what is particularly worthy of note is that when the
Earthquake had passed away, a permanent change was
found to have been effected in the level of the surrounding
country. The town and fort of Sindree, situated on the
eastern arm of the Indus, together with a tract of land 2,000
square miles in extent, were submerged beneath the waters.
The principal buildings, however, still remained standing,
with their upper parts above the surface; and many of the
inhabitants, who had taken refuge in one of the towers
attached to the fort, were saved in boats when the Earthquake
had ceased. On the other hand, within five miles
and a half of this very spot, the level surface of the Earth
was upheaved, so as to form a long elevated bank, fifty miles
in length and sixteen in breadth, which has been called the
Ullah Bund, or the Mound of God. Nine years after this
event, Sir Alexander Burnes went out in a boat to the ruins
of Sindree, and standing on the summit of the tower, which
still rose two or three feet above the surface of the water, he
could see nothing around him but a wide expanse of sea,
save where a blue streak of land on the edge of the horizon
marked the outline of the Ullah Bund. Here was a striking
illustration, on a small scale, of those changes which Geologists
suppose to have been going on since the world first
began; the dry land had been converted into the bed of the
sea, and the level plain had been elevated into a mountain
ridge.</p>

<p>Toward the close of the last century the province of Calabria,
in Southern Italy, was the scene of an Earthquake
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
which offers a very apposite illustration of our present argument.
This celebrated convulsion is not, however, chiefly
remarkable for its violence, or for its duration, or for the
extent of the territory moved. In all these respects it has
been surpassed by many Earthquakes, experienced in other
countries, within the last hundred and fifty years. But the
Calabrian Earthquake has an especial claim on our attention,
mainly from this unusual circumstance, that the region
of disturbance was visited, as Sir Charles Lyell tells us,
“both during and after the convulsions, by men possessing
sufficient leisure, zeal, and scientific information, to enable
them to collect and describe with accuracy such physical
facts as throw light on geological questions.”</p>

<p>The shocks were first felt in February, 1783, and continued
for nearly four years. Over a very considerable area
of country all the common landmarks were removed, large
tracts of land were forced bodily down the slopes of mountains;
and vineyards, orchards, and cornfields were transported
from one site to another; insomuch that disputes
afterward arose as to who was the rightful owner of the
property that had thus shifted its position. Two farms near
Mileto, occupying an extent of country a mile long and
half a mile broad, were actually removed for a mile down
the valley; and “a thatched cottage, together with large
olive and mulberry trees, most of which remained erect,
was carried uninjured to this extraordinary distance.” In
other places the surface of the Earth heaved like the billows
of a troubled sea; many houses were lifted up above the
common level, while others subsided below it. Again and
again the solid Crust of the Earth was rent asunder, and
chasms, gorges, ravines, of various depths, were suddenly
produced, in less time than it takes to tell it. Sometimes
when the strain was removed, the yawning gulf as quickly
closed again, and then houses, cattle, and men were swallowed
up in the abyss, leaving not a trace behind. It has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
even been recorded&mdash;strange though it may seem&mdash;that
when two shocks rapidly followed one another at the same
spot, the people engulphed by the first, were again cast
forth by the second, being literally disgorged alive from the
jaws of death. About 40,000 persons perished in this
dreadful visitation, the greater number being crushed to
death beneath the ruins of the towns and villages, others
swallowed up in the yawning fissures as they fled across the
open country, and others again burned in the conflagrations
which almost always followed the shocks of Earthquake.</p>

<p>Everyone has heard of the famous Earthquake of Lisbon.
It is chiefly memorable for the extreme suddenness of the
shock, for the immense extent of the area affected, and for
the amount of havoc and destruction done. On the morning
of the fatal day&mdash;it was the first of November, 1755&mdash;the
sun rose bright and cheerful over the devoted city, no
symptom of impending danger was visible in the sky above
or on the Earth below, and the gay-hearted people were
pursuing their accustomed rounds of pleasure or business,
when, suddenly, at twenty minutes before ten o’clock, a
sound like thunder was heard underground, the Earth was
violently shaken, and in another moment, the greater part
of the city was lying in ruins. Within the brief space of
six minutes, 60,000 people were crushed to death. The
mountains in the vicinity of the town were cleft asunder.
The waters of the sea first retired from the land, and then
rolled back in a huge mountain-like wave fifty feet above
the level of the highest tide. A new quay, built entirely of
marble, had offered a temporary place of refuge to the
terrified inhabitants as they fled from the tumbling ruins of
the city. Three thousand people are said to have been
collected upon it, when, all at once, it sunk beneath the
waves, and not a fragment of the solid masonry, not a vestige
of its living freight, was ever seen again. The bottom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
of the sea where the quay then stood is now a hundred
fathoms deep.</p>

<p>From Lisbon as a centre the shock of this Earthquake
radiated over an area not less than four times the extent of
Europe. Like a great wave it rolled northward, at the rate
of twenty miles a minute, upheaving the Earth as it moved
along, to the coasts of the Baltic Sea and the German
Ocean. The waters of Loch Lomond, in Scotland, were
violently disturbed from beneath, and at Kinsale, in Ireland,
the sea rushed impetuously into the harbor without a
breath of wind, and mounting over the quay, flooded the
market-place. Eastward the convulsion was felt as far as
the Alps, and westward it extended to the West India
Islands, and even to the great lakes of Canada. On the
north coast of Africa the disturbance was as violent as in
Spain and Portugal; and it is recorded that at a distance of
eight leagues from Morocco, the earth opened and swallowed
up a considerable town with its inhabitants, to the
number of eight or ten thousand people.</p>

<p>Even on the high seas the shock was felt no less distinctly
than on dry land. “Off St. Lucar,” says Sir
Charles Lyell, “the captain of the ship Nancy felt his
vessel so violently shaken, that he thought she had struck
the ground, but, on heaving the lead, found a great depth
of water. Captain Clark, from Denia, in latitude 36&deg; 24&acute;
N., between nine and ten in the morning, had his ship
shaken and strained as if she had struck upon a rock, so
that the seams of the deck opened, and the compass was
overturned in the binnacle. Another ship, forty leagues
west of St. Vincent, experienced so violent a concussion,
that the men were thrown a foot and a half perpendicularly
up from the deck.” It is worthy of note that this, the most
destructive Earthquake recorded in history, was not attended
with any volcanic eruption; which goes to confirm
our theory that the active Volcano serves as a kind of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
safety-valve for the escape of the struggling powers confined
within the Crust of the Earth.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></p>

<p>We must not bring our notice of Earthquakes to an end
without at least some brief account of one which has
startled the world even since we began to put together the
materials of this Volume. On the Western Coast of South
America there is a long, narrow strip of land, lying between
the lofty crests of the Andes and the shores of the
Pacific Ocean, which from the earliest times has been the
familiar home of Earthquakes. Toward evening on the
thirteenth of August, 1868, this fated region was the scene
of a convulsion the most appalling and destructive that has
been recorded within the present century. The disturbance
was felt in its extreme violence for a distance of 1500
miles along the coast; from Ibarra one degree north of the
Equator to Iquique more than twenty degrees south. In
ten minutes from the first shock, 20,000 people perished,
and a vast amount of property, roughly estimated at sixty
millions sterling, was utterly destroyed. Many thriving
towns&mdash;Iquique, Mexillones, Pisagua, Arica, Ylo, Chala,
and others&mdash;were levelled to the ground. Even the very
ruins were not spared. The sea rushed in when the
Earthquake shock had ceased, and carried everything before
it in one universal wreck: so that in some cases not a
vestige remained behind to tell the dismayed survivors
where their homesteads once had stood. It might be
fancied perhaps that the cities seated aloft in the security of
the Eternal Hills were beyond the reach of the convulsion
that shook the plain below. But no: Arequipa, far up on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
the slopes of the western Cordillera, and Pasco, the highest
city in the world, situated on a level with the snowy summit
of the Jungfrau, were shattered into fragments with the
same violence as the cities of the coast.</p>

<p>The various incidents recorded by the survivors are full
of fearful interest. At Iquique, according to one account,
about five o’clock in the evening of the thirteenth of August,
a rumbling noise was heard, then the earth shook violently
for some minutes, then the sea, with a great moan, retired
from the shore, and rearing itself up into a tremendous
wave, rushed back upon the land and swept away the town.
“I saw,” says one writer, “the whole surface of the sea
rise as if a mountain side, actually standing up. Another
shock, accompanied with a fearful roar, now took place.
I called to my companions to run for their lives on to the
Pampa. Too late! With a horrid crash the sea was on
us, and at one sweep&mdash;one terrible sweep&mdash;dashed what was
Iquique on to the Pampa. I lost my companions, and in
an instant was fighting with the dark water. The mighty
wave surged and roared and leaped. The cries of human
beings and animals were dreadful. A mass of wreck covered
me and kept me down, and I was fast drowning when
the sea threw me on to a beam, but a nail piercing my
coat, the timber rolled me again under, and I lost all
sense. I suppose, as in all such cases, I must have struggled
after sensation had left me, for when returning consciousness
came I was grasping under one arm a large
plank. Looking round, all was wreck and desolation. In
a moment I was by a returning wave swept into the bay,
and meeting a mass of broken timber, I was struck a fearful
blow on the chin, and the broken end of the plank
passed through my thigh. I knew no more until I found
myself on the Pampa, and all dark around me. I was
without trousers, coat, shoes, or hat. Trying to collect myself,
I thought of another wave, and crawled away to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
mountain side, scooped a hole in the ground, and got in;
here, wet and shivering, I spent the night. My wound
bled freely. In the morning I looked out and found
Iquique gone, all but a few houses round the church.”</p>

<p>A good deal of shipping was lying in the bay of Arica.
When the waters first receded the vessels were all carried
out to sea, chains, cables, and anchors snapping asunder
like packthread. A moment, afterward they were borne
back irresistibly by the returning wave, and dashed to
pieces on the coast. One more fortunate than the rest,
the Wateree, a vessel of war belonging to the United States
Government, was caught up on the crest of the wave, and
with the loss of only one man, was landed high and dry
among the sand-hills a quarter of a mile from the shore.</p>

<p>Before the Earthquake, Arequipa was a prosperous town
of 30,000 inhabitants. It enjoyed a considerable trade,
and, in importance as well as size, it was regarded as the
third city of Peru, being inferior only to Lima and Cuzco.
The houses were constructed with especial regard to security
against the shock of Earthquakes. They were but one
story high, built of solid stone, and massive to an extraordinary
degree. But these precautions, though the fruit
of long experience, were all of no avail. At Sunset on the
fatal thirteenth of August the populous and thriving city of
Arequipa was little better than a heap of ruins. “Not a
church is left standing,” writes an eye-witness, “not a house
habitable. The shock commenced at twenty minutes past
five in the afternoon, and lasted six or seven minutes. The
houses being solidly built and of one story, resisted for one
minute, which gave the people time to rush into the middle
of the streets, so that the mortality, although considerable,
is not so great as might have been expected. If the
Earthquake had occurred at night, few indeed would have
been left to tell the story. As it is, the prisoners in the
public prison, and the sick in the hospital, have perished.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
The Earthquake commenced with an undulating movement,
and as the shock culminated, no one could keep his
feet: the houses rocked as a ship in the trough of the sea,
and came crumbling down. The shrieks of the women, the
crash of falling masonry, the upheaving of the earth, and
the clouds of blinding dust, made up a scene that cannot
be described. We had nineteen minor shocks the same
night, and the earth still continues in motion. Nothing
has as yet been done toward disinterring the dead; but I do
not think any are buried alive, as certain death must have
been the fate of all those who were not able to get into the
street. The earth has opened in all the plains around,
and water has appeared in various places.”<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<p>These are a few typical examples of the more violent
convulsions by which the Crust of the Earth has been disturbed
within little more than a century; and they leave
no doubt as to the kind of changes which may fairly be
ascribed to similar agency in the past history of the Globe.
Nor must it be supposed that, because our examples are
few in number, the Earthquake is itself a rare and exceptional
event. On the contrary, the state of partial disturbance
and convulsion would seem to be the natural and
ordinary condition of our planet. From the interesting
Catalogue drawn up by Mr. Mallet, it appears that, in our
own times, the number of Earthquakes actually observed
and recorded is, on an average, not less than from two to
three every week. Now this catalogue cannot represent
more than one-third of the Globe: for the disturbances
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
which take place in the profound depths of the ocean must
for the most part escape observation, and many parts even
of the inhabited Earth are still beyond the reach of scientific
researches. It is, therefore, quite a reasonable speculation
of Sir Charles Lyell, that “scarcely a day passes
without one or more shocks being experienced in some
part of the Globe.”</p>

<p>Moreover, in Mr. Mallet’s Catalogue no account is taken
of those minor vibrations or tremblings of the Earth’s
Crust, which are not attended by any striking or noteworthy
event. And yet such phenomena, when often repeated,
may produce a very important change of level, and are far
more frequent than most persons would be likely to suppose.
In our quiet region of the Globe people are too apt
to take for granted the general stability of the Earth: but
in other countries the inhabitants, warned by long experience,
are no less deeply impressed with a conviction of its
instability. Sir John Herschel says that, in the volcanic
regions of Central and Southern America, “the inhabitants
no more think of counting Earthquake shocks, than we do
of counting showers of rain:” nay, he adds that, “in some
places along the coast a shower is a greater variety.” And
in Sicily, we are told they make provision against movements
of the Earth’s Crust, just as we make provision against
lightning and storms; so much so that it is quite a common
thing for architects to advertise their houses as Earth-quake-proof.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">So</span> far we have spoken of the disturbance of the
Earth’s Crust in modern times by sudden and
violent convulsions. But there are many phenomena
with which the Geologist is familiar, that cannot
be fairly accounted for unless by supposing that the surface
of the Earth was often elevated and depressed in ancient
times, without any sudden shock, by a slow and almost insensible
movement. And, accordingly, gentle undulations
of this kind enter largely into that general theory of Geology
which we have been attempting to draw out and illustrate.
It may be asked, therefore, if we are able to support this
part of our system by examples of similar phenomena occurring
within the period of history. In reply, we shall
endeavor to set forth, as briefly as we can, some of the evidence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
which has recently come to light on this subject, and
which seems to us not less conclusive than it is interesting
and unexpected.</p>

<p>In the bay of Bai&aelig;, to the west of Naples, two ancient
Roman roads may be distinctly traced, at the present day,
for a considerable distance, permanently submerged beneath
the waters. There are, also, in the same neighborhood,
the ruins of the temple of Neptune and of the temple
of the Nymphs, both likewise submerged. “The columns
of the former edifice stand erect in five feet of water, the
upper portions just rising to the surface;<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> the pedestals are
supposed to be buried in the mud below.” Again, on the
opposite side of Naples, near Sorrento, “a road with fragments
of Roman buildings, is covered to some depth by
the sea;”<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> and in the island of Capri, at the opening of the
bay of Naples, one of the palaces of Tiberius is also under
water. Here, therefore, it is clear that the Crust of the Earth
has subsided over a very considerable area; since what is
now the bed of the sea, was in the days of the Romans dry
land, traversed by roads, and dotted over with buildings.
That the subsidence was slow and gradual may be inferred,
partly from the absence of any record or tradition of a sudden
convulsion producing such a change, and partly, too,
from the unshaken and undisturbed condition of the monuments
themselves.</p>

<p>But while this conclusion falls in most happily with our
present argument, it would seem on further examination to
bring with it a very serious difficulty. For, while those
ancient monuments testify that the Crust of the Earth in
this locality has <i>subsided</i>, the structure of the sea-coast, interpreted
according to Geological principles, would indicate,
on the contrary, that the Crust of the Earth has been <i>upheaved</i>.
Close to the sea, at the present day, on the bay of
Bai&aelig;, there is a low, level tract of fertile land, and at a little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
distance inland, a lofty range of precipitous cliffs, eighty
feet high, parallel to the line of the coast. This fertile
tract, lying between the sea-beach and the perpendicular
cliffs, is about twenty feet above the sea level, and is composed
of regularly stratified deposits abounding in marine
shells of recent species, together with works of human art,
such as tiles, squares of mosaic pavement, fragments of
bricks, and sculptured ornaments. Upon these facts a
Geologist would pronounce without hesitation:&mdash;First,
that at some period since the district around Naples was
first inhabited by man, the waters of the sea washed the
base of the perpendicular cliffs; secondly, that the strata in
which we now find the recent marine shells, and the remains
of man’s workmanship, were formed during that
period by the process of deposition at the bottom of the
sea; and thirdly, that at some subsequent time, by an upheaval
of the Earth’s Crust, these strata were lifted up so as
to form a pretty considerable area of dry land, fit for agriculture
and the arts of life.</p>

<p>Does it not seem, therefore, that we have here a direct
contradiction between the evidence of ancient Roman
buildings and the inferences of modern Geology? Doubtless,
they both agree in the main point about which we
are concerned just now, that the Crust of the Earth has
been moved in recent times on the shores of the bay of
Naples; but according to the testimony of the Roman temples,
now covered by water, this movement has been one
of <i>subsidence</i>, while, according to the inferences of Geological
theory, it has been one of <i>upheaval</i>. This apparent
contradiction seems to call for some elucidation.</p>

<p>If we were left in this matter to mere conjecture, we
might offer the following hypothesis as a fair and reasonable
solution. We might suppose that since the days of the
Roman Empire, there have been <i>two successive movements</i> of
the Earth’s Crust in the neighborhood of Naples; first, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
movement of subsidence, by which the ancient temples and
roads were submerged to a considerable depth beneath the
sea; afterward, a movement of upheaval, by which the
marine strata were lifted up. If this second movement were
exactly equal to the first, it is plain that the ancient roads
and buildings would have been just restored to their former
level. But let us suppose that the amount of upheaval was
something less than the amount of previous subsidence,
and we should have these roads and buildings still submerged,
as they are in point of fact, in a few feet of water.
By such an hypothesis, therefore, the two classes of phenomena
might be brought into perfect harmony.</p>

<p>But we are not obliged to take refuge in hypothesis: for
it is now distinctly proved by a very curious kind of evidence,
that the Crust of the Earth in and about the bay of
Bai&aelig;, has been successively depressed and upraised since
the third century of the Christian era; nay more, that the
subsidence in the first case was greater than the subsequent
upheaval. Near Pozzuoli, on the level tract of land which,
as we have said, intervenes between the sea and the lofty
range of inland cliffs, are to be seen at the present day the
ruins of a splendid Roman edifice, usually called the temple
of Jupiter Serapis, though, according to some writers,
it was not a temple at all, but a public establishment for
baths. These ruins first attracted attention about the middle
of the last century. Three magnificent marble columns
were still standing erect, with their lower parts buried in the
stratified deposits already described, and their upper portions,
which projected above the surface of the land, partly
concealed by bushes. When the soil was removed the
original plan of the building could be distinctly traced.
“It was of a quadrangular form, seventy feet in diameter,
and the roof had been supported by forty-six noble columns,
twenty-four of granite and the rest of marble.” Many
of the pillars have been shattered in the course of time, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
lie strewn in fragments on the pavements. The three
which are still standing erect, are upward of forty feet
in height, each carved out of a solid block of marble; and,
what is chiefly to our purpose, they exhibit, curiously
inscribed on their surface, memorials of the physical
changes in which they have borne a part.</p>

<p>The base of these lofty columns is, at present, slightly
below the level of the sea. Their outer surface is smooth
for about twelve feet above the pedestals; then, for the next
nine feet the marble is everywhere bored by a well-known
species of mussel, which it is certain can live only in the
sea. Above this band of perforations the pillars again present
a smooth surface, and continue smooth to the top.
The first inference from these facts is, that the columns in
question must have been at one time submerged to a height
of twenty-one feet above the pedestals; otherwise they could
not have been bored at that height by a species of animal that
can only exist in sea-water. Since that time, therefore, the
land at this spot must have been upraised twenty-one feet.
Furthermore, the temple of Jupiter was certainly not built
at the bottom of the sea, but upon dry land; therefore,
after the temple had been built, the Crust of the Earth must
have subsided at least twenty-one feet. Once more: as the
floor of the temple is now somewhat below the level of the
sea, and as it is not very likely it was at first so built, we may
fairly infer that it is now lower than it originally stood; and
consequently, that the total amount of upheaval has not been
equal to the total amount of subsidence. Though we cannot
fix the exact date at which the subsidence began, it was
probably not earlier than the third century; for in the atrium
of the temple is an inscription recording that it was
adorned with precious marbles by the emperor Septimus
Severus.</p>

<p>It cannot be supposed for a moment that these changes
were effected by a rise and fall in the level of the sea rather
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
than by a movement of the Earth’s Crust. A permanent
change in the level of the Mediterranean, in any given
locality, would, of necessity, imply a change of level over
its entire extent; and therefore, if the phenomena exhibited
in the bay of Bai&aelig; arose from such a cause, we should
meet with phenomena of the same kind along the whole
length of the Italian coast. Now, in point of fact, no such
changes of level are elsewhere apparent; and consequently,
they must be ascribed in the bay of Bai&aelig;, not to an upward
and downward movement of the sea, but to an upward and
downward movement of the land.</p>

<p>We must not omit to state, before leaving the subject,
that it is now ascertained, by a series of accurate observations,
that the Crust of the Earth in this interesting locality
is once again slowly and gradually subsiding. At the beginning
of the century the platform of the temple stood at
about the level of the sea; it is now more than a foot below
it. Nay, this second subsidence appears to have begun
even before the present century. “In the year 1813,”
writes a modern traveller, “I resided for four months in
the Capuchin convent of Pozzuoli, which is situated between
the road from Naples and the sea, at the entrance of the
town of Pozzuoli. In the Capuchin convents the oldest
friar is called ‘il molto reverende,’ and the one who
then enjoyed the title in this convent was ninety-three years
old. He informed me that, when he was a young man,
the road from Naples passed on the <i>seaward side</i> of the convent;
but that, from the gradual sinking of the soil, the
road was obliged to be altered to its present course. While
I was staying at the convent, the refectory as well as the
entrance gate, were from six inches to a foot under water
whenever strong westerly winds prevailed, so as to cause
the waters of the Mediterranean to rise. Thirty years previously,
my old informant stated, such an occurrence never
took place. In fact, it is not probable that the builder of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
the convent would have placed the ground-floor so low as
to expose to inundation as it now is.”<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></p>

<p>On the shores of the Baltic Sea we find another illustration
of our theory upon a more extended scale. About a
century and a half ago the Swedish naturalist, Celsius, expressed
a belief that a remarkable change of level was
taking place along the eastern coast of Scandinavia; and
he ascribed the change to a subsidence of the waters of the
Baltic Sea. This opinion was received at first with no
small amount of incredulity; but the arguments of Celsius
were plausible and attractive enough to excite a controversy,
and the controversy once aroused was not easily set
at rest. Accordingly, since his time the facts upon which
he relied have been more strictly examined, difficulties
have been started and investigated, many new facts, at first
unknown or unnoticed, have been brought to light, and
the whole question has been rigorously discussed by scientific
men. It would be tedious to go through the history
of the discussion, or to develop at any length the arguments
which in the end have proved successful, involving as they
do a multitude of minute observations and nice measurements,
made at a great variety of different places with
hard-sounding names. But the general result may be
readily stated and as readily understood.</p>

<p>It appears that numerous sunken reefs, well known to
navigators, have, within the last two centuries, become visible
above water; that many ancient ports have become
inland towns; that many small islands have become united
to one another and to the mainland by grassy plains; that
rocky points which in former times just peeped above the
water, and afforded refuge only to a solitary sea-bird, are
now grown into little islets; and that several of the old fishing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
grounds are now deserted for their shallowness, nay, in
some cases, altogether dried up. From these facts the
inference is plain; either the solid Crust of the Earth has
been uplifted, or the waters of the sea have subsided. Now
it is certain there has been no subsidence of the sea; for
such a subsidence, as we before observed, if it took place
at all, should have been general; whereas there are many
points on the shores of the Baltic, especially along the
coasts of Denmark and Prussia, where it can be proved
that no change of level has taken place for centuries.
And therefore the phenomena above described we must
attribute to an upheaval of the Earth’s Crust.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<p>Such is the kind of reasoning with which this inquiry
has been pursued; and it may now be set down as a received
and established fact, that a slow and gradual process
of upheaval is going on, at the present day, on the
shores of the Baltic Sea, at the rate of from two to four
feet in a century; and this is over an area of unknown
breadth, and not less than 1000 miles in length. Evidence
of a similar kind has lately been adduced to prove that the
west coast of Greenland is just now gradually subsiding
for a space of more than 600 miles from north to south.
“Ancient buildings on low, rocky islands, and on the
shore of the mainland, have been gradually submerged,
and experience has taught the aboriginal Greenlander
never to build his hut near the water’s edge. In one case
the Moravian settlers have been obliged more than once to
move the poles upon which their large boats were set, and
the old poles still remain beneath the water as silent witnesses
of the change.”<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></p>

<p>It should seem, therefore, that the Crust of the Earth is
not that fixed and immovable mass of unyielding rock which
it is often supposed to be. Whatever the gigantic power
is which lies shut up within it, and which seems, clearly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
enough, to be developed in some way or another&mdash;perhaps
in many ways at once&mdash;from internal heat, that power exercises
a mighty influence from age to age on the outward
form of our planet. Like the wind, indeed, it bloweth
where it listeth, and we cannot tell whence it cometh or
whither it goeth; but we can hear the sound thereof, and
witness its effects when it breaks out now in this quarter of
the world, and now in that, bursting open the massive
rocks, and furiously vomiting forth whole mountains of
smouldering ashes and molten mineral; or again, when,
failing to find a vent, it shakes the foundations of the hills,
and shivers into fragments the most enduring works of
man&mdash;castles, temples, palaces,&mdash;filling every heart with
terror and dismay; or, in fine, when it gently upheaves the
bottom of the ocean, or by withdrawing the strain, allows
the Crust of the Earth to subside, with a movement so gradual
and insensible as to escape the notice of the multitudes
who are toiling in the busy cities on its Surface. That phenomena
of this kind have been going on in all past ages,
is now universally assumed in the speculations of Geology:
that they are going on in the present age, we have here
endeavored to prove by the evidence of facts. If we have
succeeded according to our expectations, the reader will be
prepared to admit that, on this point at least, it is not the
Geologist who may fairly be charged with having recourse
to the inventions of his fancy, but rather those who, assuming
as a first principle that Geology is false, perseveringly
shut their eyes to the physical changes that are going on
around them.

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span> reader has now before him a general outline
of Geological theory, together with some familiar
illustrations of the evidence by which it is supported.
We shall not attempt to enforce this evidence by
any remarks of our own. Indeed it is of a kind that
can derive but little aid from the arts of logic or rhetoric.
It needs but to be fairly understood, and if it does not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
altogether compel our assent, it begets at least a presumption
so strong as to leave little room for doubt or hesitation.</p>

<p>Nobody, so far as we know, has ever hesitated to believe
that the Round Towers of Ireland are the work of
human hands. And yet if some incredulous skeptic were
to raise the cry against this common opinion, were to argue
that it is a mere hypothesis, and call for proof, we should
be embarrassed how to answer him. We could only say
that these monuments have all the characteristic marks
of man’s handiwork; and that buildings of this kind have
never been known to come into existence except through
the agency of Man. But should our vexatious skeptic contend
that they were possibly produced by a freak of Nature;
or that they were built in the beginning by the Creator of
the World, who certainly might have made them had He
been so minded, we should think him very unreasonable,
and probably not feel much disposed to prolong the discussion.
In like manner the theory of Geology which we
are defending, cannot be established by a rigid demonstration;
but we believe there is not one man of sense and
judgment, who, being fully master of the evidence on
which it rests, hesitates to accept that theory, at least in its
more general outlines. No doubt many able and eminent
men are to be found arrayed against Geology; but it would
be easy to show from their writings that they have never
thoroughly examined the facts about which they talk so
flippantly, and which they often set aside so lightly.</p>

<p>For ourselves, therefore, we frankly avow that while we
attach but little importance to the mere conjectures and
speculations of Geological writers; while we look with
doubt and suspicion on many plausible theories commonly
enough adopted at the present day; and while we consider
that the discoveries of modern times, wonderful
though they are, have given rise to far more problems than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
they are yet able to solve; yet we do fully assent to those
general principles which we have been attempting to develop
and to illustrate in this Volume. Absolutely metaphysical
certainty we have not; but we have a firm and rational conviction.
We feel quite satisfied that the great Creator of
the Universe did not bring suddenly into existence the
withered remains and broken fragments of animals which
had never lived; that He did not stamp upon the massive
rocks, buried in the profound recesses of the earth, the impress
of a luxuriant vegetation which had never flourished;
that He did not, in short, create under millions of forms, the
delusive appearances of things which had never been, and
scatter them through this world of ours in wild profusion,
well knowing that after many centuries they would come to
light to bewilder human reason, and to lead it into error.
This conclusion, of course, we are prepared to abandon if
it should be found to clash with any certain truth or with
any demonstrated fact. But, in the mean lime, it seems to
us as well grounded and as fairly established as the conclusions
we are accustomed to accept without hesitation in
the matter of other sciences, and in the common business
of life.</p>

<p>It is argued, however, that Geological theory is, in fact,
at variance with the very highest order of truth; with that
truth which comes to us on the authority of God Himself.
The Bible tells us that the world first came into existence
about six or eight thousand years ago: Geology, on the
contrary, tells us that six or eight thousand years are but as
yesterday in the history of the revolutions through which
our Globe has passed. This is the argument to which we
are now about to address ourselves; and it well deserves
our best attention, not only from its intrinsic importance,
but also from the interesting nature of the discussion to
which it has given rise.</p>

<p>In the first place, we fully admit that the extreme
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
Antiquity of the Earth is a necessary consequence of our
theory. Setting out from the present stage of the world’s
existence, Geology carries us back from epoch to epoch,
through a long succession of ages, each extending over
many thousand years, until the mind is lost in the seeming
infinity of the past. It may be asked, perhaps, in what way
Geology can testify to the great length of each successive
period in the history of the Globe. A familiar example will
furnish the most convenient reply to such a question.</p>

<p>Let the reader call to mind what we have already explained
about the origin and formation of Coal; and then
let him examine the structure of the Carboniferous Rocks.
In the great Coal-fields of Wales, for instance, he will find,
in a depth of 12,000 feet, from fifty to a hundred distinct
beds of coals, spread out one above another, with intervening
strata of clay several feet thick. Now each one of these
beds represents an ancient forest which must have grown
up and flourished and decayed; or else an immense and
varied mass of Drift-wood, transported from a distance by
the action of moving water, and deposited near the mouth
of some great river. In either case a considerable lapse of
time would have been necessary for such an accumulation
of vegetable matter as would furnish the elements even of a
single seam of Coal. And, when that period came to an
end, only one little stage in the long series had been accomplished:
one stratum of a few feet had been laid down in
that great Formation which was to reach at length a height
of more than two miles. A new condition of things then
ensued. This layer of vegetable matter, sunk below the
waters, was gradually covered over with a thick deposit of
clay, which, in course of time, was to emerge, and become
dry land, and give birth to a second forest, destined in its
turn to wither and decay. Or, at least, when the stratum
of clay had been deposited, it was to be overlaid, in some
way or another, with a second layer of vegetable matter sufficient
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
for the production of a second bed of coal. And so
this process must have gone on, doubtless with many and
long interruptions, for a hundred times in succession.</p>

<p>Then it must be remembered that the Coal-bearing strata
represent but one of many periods, and that not the longest
in the Geological Calendar. Before the age of the Coal,
England was for centuries at the bottom of the sea, while
the Old Red Sandstone was slowly spread out over its existing
surface. And after the age of the Coal, England was
again submerged, and gigantic Ichthyosaurs with their companions
of the deep, sported in the waters that rolled over
her plains and covered the tops of her mountains; and,
when they had run their course, left their remains buried
in the clays of Oxfordshire and Warwickshire and Dorsetshire.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the beds in which these monstrous reptiles
are entombed were overlaid by a stratum of calcareous ooze,
now forming a solid mass of Chalk Rock, often a thousand
feet in thickness. This Chalk, as we have seen, is nothing
else than a vast accumulation of shells, so minute that millions
of them would fit together on the blade of a small pen-knife,
and hundreds of millions are carried about by every
carpenter in his waistcoat pocket. How many generations
of animalcules it took to pile up such an immense thickness
of rock, by the action of their vital powers, and how
many ages were consumed in the process it is beyond the
reach of science to calculate, almost beyond the power of
imagination to conceive. And yet the Chalk itself was followed
by the various Formations of the Tertiary Age; while
the last of these is separated by the Drift and Boulder Clay
from the superficial deposits which correspond with the
period of history, and which go by the name of Recent.</p>

<p>This topic has been illustrated in a lively and striking
manner by Professor Huxley, in a Lecture delivered not
long ago before the working-men of Norwich. “At Cromer,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
he says, “one of the most charming spots on the
coast of Norfolk, you will see the Boulder Clay forming a
vast mass, which lies upon the Chalk, and must consequently
have come into existence after it. Huge boulders
of chalk are, in fact, included in the clay, and have evidently
been brought to the position they now occupy by
the same agency as that which has planted blocks of
syenite from Norway side by side with them.</p>

<p>“The Chalk, then, is certainly older than the Boulder
Clay. If you ask how much, I will again take you no further
than the same spot upon your own coasts for evidence.
I have spoken of the Boulder Clay and Drift as resting
upon the Chalk. That is not strictly true. Interposed
between the Chalk and the Drift is a comparatively insignificant
layer, containing vegetable matter. But that layer
tells a wonderful history. It is full of stumps of trees
standing as they grew. Fir-trees are there with their cones,
and hazel-bushes with their nuts; there stand the stools of
oak and yew trees, beeches and alders. Hence this stratum
is appropriately called the Forest-bed.</p>

<p>“It is obvious that the Chalk must have been upheaved
and converted into dry land before the timber trees could
grow upon it. As the trunks of some of these trees are
from two to three feet in diameter, it is no less clear that
the dry land thus formed remained in the same condition
for long ages. And not only do the remains of stately
oaks and well-grown firs testify to the duration of this condition
of things, but additional evidence to the same effect
is afforded by the abundant remains of elephants, rhinoceroses,
hippopotamuses, and other great wild beasts, which
it has yielded to the zealous search of such men as the
Reverend Mr. Gunn.</p>

<p>“When you look at such a collection as he has formed,
and bethink you that these elephantine bones did veritably
carry their owners about, and these great grinders crunch
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
in the dark woods of which the Forest-bed is now the only
trace, it is impossible not to feel that they are as good evidence
of the lapse of time as the annual rings of the tree-stumps.</p>

<p>“Thus there is a writing upon the wall of cliffs at Cromer,
and whoso runs may read it. It tells us with an authority
which cannot be impeached, that the ancient bed of
the Chalk sea was raised up and remained dry land until
it was covered with forest, stocked with the great game
whose spoils have rejoiced your Geologists. How long it
remained in that condition cannot be said; but the ‘whirligig
of time brought its revenges’ in those days as in these.
That dry land, with the bones and teeth of generations of
long-lived elephants hidden away among the gnarled roots
and dry leaves of its ancient trees, sank gradually to the
bottom of the icy sea, which covered it with huge masses
of Drift and Boulder Clay. Sea-beasts, such as the walrus,
now restricted to the extreme north, paddled about where
birds had twittered among the topmost twigs of the fir-trees.
How long this state of things endured we know not, but at
length it came to an end. The upheaved glacial mud
hardened into the soil of modern Norfolk. Forests grew
once more, the wolf and the beaver replaced the reindeer
and the elephant; and at length what we called the history
of England, dawned.</p>

<p>“Thus evidence which cannot be rebutted, and which
need not be strengthened, though, if time permitted, I
might indefinitely increase its quantity, compels you to believe
that the Earth from the time of the Chalk to the present
day, has been the theatre of a series of changes as vast
in their amount as they were slow in their progress. The
area on which we stand has been first sea and then land for
at least four alternations, and has remained in each of these
conditions for a period of great length.</p>

<p>“Nor have these wonderful metamorphoses of the sea
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
into land, and of land into sea, been confined to one corner
of England. During the Chalk Period not one of the
present great physical features of the Globe was in existence.
Our great mountain ranges, Pyrenees, Alps, Himalayas,
Andes, have all been upheaved since the Chalk was deposited,
and the Cretaceous sea flowed over the sites of Sinai
and Ararat.</p>

<p>“All this is certain, because rocks of Cretaceous or still
later date have shared in the elevatory movements which
gave rise to these mountain chains, and may be found
perched up, in some cases, many thousand feet high upon
their flanks. And evidence of equal cogency demonstrates
that, though in Norfolk the Forest-bed rests directly upon
the Chalk, yet it does so, not because the period at which
the forest grew immediately followed that at which the Chalk
was formed, but because an immense lapse of time, represented
elsewhere by thousands of feet of rock, is not indicated
at Cromer.</p>

<p>“I must ask you to believe that there is no less conclusive
proof that a still more prolonged succession of similar
changes occurred before the Chalk was deposited. Nor
have we any reason to think that the first term in the series
of these changes is known. The oldest sea-beds preserved
to us are sands and mud and pebbles, the wear and tear of
rocks which were formed in still older oceans.”<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></p>

<p>It is needless to pursue this subject further, or to seek
for other illustrations. We may reject Geology if we will:
but if we put any faith even in its main principles, we must
believe that the Crust of the Earth has passed through an
indefinite series of revolutions, during which the Stratified
Rocks were slowly built up by the action of natural causes.
And it would be utterly ridiculous to suppose that the history
of these revolutions can be compressed into the narrow
compass of six thousand years.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span></p>

<p>Turning now to the other side of the question, we maintain
that this extreme Antiquity of the Earth, which we
have learned from Geology, is perfectly consistent with the
historical narrative of the Bible. The Bible, indeed, does
fix the Chronology of the Human Race at a comparatively
recent period; but as for the Chronology of the World
itself, the Bible simply tells us that, “In the beginning
God created the Heavens and the Earth.” For all that
appears to the contrary, this Earth of ours may have been
in existence for millions of years before man was introduced
upon the scene; and during that time may have been peopled
with those countless tribes of plants and animals which
play so important a part in the records of Geology. This
view, which is not only fully tolerated by the Church, but
now largely supported by her Divines and Commentators,
we hope to bring home clearly to our readers in the following
pages; and thus to satisfy them that, as regards the
Antiquity of the Earth, the discoveries of Geology can offer
no prejudice to our religious belief.</p>

<p>At the outset it is of some importance to understand clearly
the nature of that system of Chronology which is gathered
from the Bible. Nowhere in the Sacred Text is the age of
the human race explicitly set forth. But various data are
found scattered here and there through the historical narrative,
which afford us sufficient materials to compute the
years that elapsed from the Creation of Adam to the Birth
of Christ. Unfortunately, however, these data are in some
respects obscure, and in some respects uncertain. And
thus it has come to pass that many different systems of
Chronology have come into vogue, even amongst those
who profess to be guided entirely by the authority of the
Bible.</p>

<p>The whole period may be conveniently divided into two
parts;&mdash;from the Creation of Adam to the Call of Abraham;
and from the call of Abraham to the Birth of Christ. As
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
regards the latter interval, the difference of opinion between
Chronologists is not very substantial; the length of the
period may be roughly set down at about 2,000 years. But
in the computation of the former interval a very wide difference
prevails, arising from a diversity of reading in the
earliest versions of the Pentateuch.</p>

<p>The materials for the computation are derived from two
genealogical lists, one extending from Adam to Noah,<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> the
other from Noah to Abraham.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> In these lists we have
not only the direct line of descent from father to son, extending
through the whole period in question, but, moreover,
we have the age of each individual member of the
genealogy at the time when the next in succession was born.
As, for example:&mdash;“Adam lived <i>a hundred and thirty years,
and begot a son</i> to his own image and likeness, and called
his name Seth. And the days of Adam, after he had begot
Seth, were eight hundred years: and he begot sons and
daughters. And all the time that Adam lived came to
nine hundred and thirty years, and he died. Seth also
lived <i>a hundred and five years, and begot Enos</i>. And Seth
lived, after he begot Enos, eight hundred and seven years,
and begot sons and daughters. And all the days of Seth
were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died. And
Enos lived <i>ninety years, and begot Cainan:</i>”<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> and so on.
Now it is plain, according to this statement, that from the
Creation of Adam to the birth of Seth was a hundred and
thirty years; to the birth of Enos, a hundred and thirty,
more a hundred and five years; to the birth of Cainan, a
hundred and thirty, more a hundred and five, more ninety
years. And in this way, following the genealogies of the
Book of Genesis, we may easily compute the time from
the Creation of Adam to the Birth of Abraham. Adding
seventy-five years to this period, we reach the epoch known
as the Call of Abraham; for we are told that “Abraham
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
was seventy and five years old when he went forth from
Haran.”<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></p>

<p>Now every one knows that when a long catalogue of
names and numbers is copied and recopied from age to
age, errors are very likely to creep in and be perpetuated.
And so it has been in the present case. The three
earliest versions of the Pentateuch are the Hebrew, the
Samaritan, and the Septuagint: and between these three
versions there is a very great discrepancy with regard to the
figures in question; so great, indeed, as to make up, on
the whole, a difference of 1500 years, or more, in the age
of the human race. In the table that appears on the following
page, for which we are mainly indebted to the work
of a modern writer,<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> this diversity of reading is set forth in
a very simple and intelligible form.</p>

<p>It is plain that of these three different versions, one only
can represent the true age of the human race when Abraham
went forth, at the command of God, from his country
and his kindred and his father’s house, to go into the land
of Canaan: and at this distance of time, it is impossible to
determine with anything like certainty, which of the three
has the greatest claim on our acceptance. The Church
has not pronounced upon the subject; and the question is
freely discussed among Biblical scholars. But the details of
this controversy have little to do with our present argument.
Enough it is for us to know that, from the Creation of
Adam to the Birth of Christ, cannot have been more than
six thousand years at the highest computation, nor much
less than four thousand at the lowest. Adding 1869 years
of the Christian Era, the present age of the Human Race
according to the data of the Bible would seem to lie between
six and eight thousand years.

<p>The Bible, then, does determine, though with some
vagueness and uncertainty, the age of the Human Race.
We have now to consider whether, in fixing the age of the
Human Race, it fixes likewise the age of the World itself.
For this purpose we must turn our attention to the first
chapter of Genesis, in which is briefly set forth the origin
and early history of our Globe from the Creation of the
Heavens and the Earth in the beginning to the Creation of
Man at the close of the Sixth Day. If it should appear
that these two events were comprised within a very narrow
limit of time, as is not unfrequently supposed, then indeed
the age of the world must agree pretty nearly with the age
of the Human Race. But if on the other hand, between
these two events the Sacred Record allows us to suppose an
interval of indefinite length, then it plainly follows that the
age of the Human Race, as set forth in the Bible Genealogies,
can afford no evidence against the Antiquity of the
Earth. The question is thus brought within very narrow
limits. We have simply to take up the First Chapter of
Genesis, and inquire whether or no it is there conveyed
that the Creation of Man, which is described toward the
close of the chapter, followed after the lapse of only a few
days upon the Creation of the Heavens and the Earth,
which is recorded in the first verse.</p>

<p>For many centuries this question received but little
attention from the readers of the Bible. It was commonly
assumed that, as the various events of the Creation are
traced out in rapid succession by the Inspired Writer, and
strung together into one continuous narrative, so did they
follow one another, in reality, with a corresponding rapidity,
and in the same unbroken continuity. The progress of
Physical Science had not yet shown any necessity for supposing
a lengthened period of time to have elapsed between
the Creation of the World and the Creation of Man: nor
was there anything in the narrative itself to suggest such an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
idea. Thus it was generally taken for granted, almost
without discussion, that when God had created the Heavens
and the Earth in the beginning, He <i>at once</i> set about the
work of arranging and furnishing the universe, and fitting
it up for the use of man; that He distributed this work
over a period of six ordinary days, and at the close of the
sixth day, introduced our First Parents upon the scene:
and that, therefore, the beginning of the Human Race was
but six days later than the beginning of the World.</p>

<p>These notions about the history of the Creation continued
to prevail almost down to our own time. It is to be observed,
however, that they were not founded on a close and scientific
examination of the Sacred Text. The hypothesis of a
long and eventful state of existence prior to the Creation of
Man may be said rather to have been overlooked, than to
have been rejected, by our Commentators. There was no
good reasons for entertaining such a speculation, and so
they said nothing about it. But now that the world is
ringing with the wonderful discoveries of Geology, which
seem to point more and more clearly every day to the
extreme Antiquity of the Earth, it becomes an imperative
duty to examine once again with all diligence and care the
Inspired narrative of the Creation, and to consider well the
relation in which it stands with this new dogma of Physical
Science.</p>

<p>We are not the first to enter upon the inquiry. Already
it has engaged the attention and stimulated the industry of
Theological writers for more than half a century. Many
eminent men, distinguished alike for their extensive acquirements
and for their religious zeal, have protested warmly
against the opinion of Geologists, concerning the Antiquity
of the Earth, as one that cannot be reconciled with the historical
accuracy of the Bible. But, on the other hand, there
are writers no less illustrious, and no less sincerely attached
to the cause of religion, who contend that there is nothing in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
the Sacred Text to exclude the supposition of a long and
indefinite interval&mdash;an interval if necessary of many millions
of years&mdash;between the first creation of matter and the creation
of man. Thirty years ago this opinion was defended
by Cardinal Wiseman with great learning, and with great
felicity of illustration, in his famous Lectures on the Connection
between Science and Revealed Religion. The eminent
Roman Jesuit, Father Perrone, has followed the same
line of argument in his Pr&aelig;lectiones Theologic&aelig;, which, as
every one knows, has long since become a classic work in
schools of Theology. It has been yet more fully discussed,
and supported by more elaborate reasoning, in a work entitled
Cosmogonia Naturale Comparata col Genesi, lately
published in Rome at the press of the Civilt&agrave; Cattolica,
by another distinguished Jesuit, John Baptist Pianciani.
Amongst Protestant writers, too, this view of the Mosaic
narrative has found no inconsiderable number of able advocates.
It is defended by Doctor Buckland, the eminent
Geologist, in his celebrated Bridgewater Treatise, by Doctor
Chalmers in his Evidences of the Christian Revelation, by
Doctor Pye Smith in his dissertations on Geology and Scripture,
by the eloquent and original Hugh Miller in his interesting
work on the Testimony of the Rocks; and by a host
of others scarcely less distinguished than these.</p>

<p>But these learned writers are not altogether of one accord
as to the precise point in the First Chapter of Genesis, at
which we may suppose a long interval of time to have intervened.
Some, with Doctor Buckland, Doctor Pye Smith,
and Doctor Chalmers, consider that this interval may best be
introduced between the beginning of all time, when God
created the Heavens and the Earth, and the beginning of
the First Day, when He set about preparing the world as a
dwelling-place for man. Sacred Scripture, they say, simply
records these two events, (1) that “In the beginning God
created the Heavens and the Earth,” and (2) that, at some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
subsequent time, “God said: Let there be light: and light
was made.” But Sacred Scripture does not tell us what
length of time elapsed between these two great acts of Divine
Omnipotence. For aught we know from Revelation, it may
have been but a single day, or it may have been a million
of years. Others again, as for instance Pianciani, prefer
to suppose that each one of the Six Days may have been
itself a period of indefinite, nay of almost inconceivable
duration. So that, between the beginning of the world and
the creation of man six great ages of the Earth’s history may
have rolled by, each one distinguished by a new manifestation
of God’s power, and the introduction of new forms of
life. These writers even fancy that they can discover a close
analogy between the successive acts of creation recorded in
Genesis, and the gradual development of organic life exhibited
in the great Epochs of Geology.</p>

<p>To us it seems that either one or the other of these two
systems, or both together, may be fairly admitted without
any undue violence to the text of the Inspired narrative: and
this, we would observe in passing, is the opinion to which
Cardinal Wiseman appears to have inclined, thirty years ago,
in his Lectures on the Connection between Science and Religion.
We maintain, then, in the first place, that there is
nothing in the Mosaic narrative, when carefully examined,
at variance with the hypothesis of an indefinite interval between
the creation of the world and the work of the Six Days.
And, in the second place, we contend that it is quite consistent
with the usage of Sacred Scripture to explain these Days
of Creation as long periods of time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It may appear, perhaps, to some of our readers that this
is dangerous ground on which we are about to venture.
They may have been accustomed all their lives to view the
history of Creation through the medium of those notions
that commonly prevailed before the discoveries of Geology:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
and from the influence of long association they may have
come, in the end, to regard their own interpretation with
scarcely less veneration than the Inspired Text itself. Such
persons will naturally be disposed to look upon our undertaking
with disfavor and suspicion. They will think us
guilty of irreverence toward Holy Scripture when we seek
to modify our views about its meaning, in deference to the
conclusions of Physical Science; and they may be tempted
even to charge us with putting the idle interpretations of
men into the balance against the Inspired Word of God.</p>

<p>To this line of objection we would answer, that we cannot
be guilty of irreverence to the Holy Scripture, when we
are only striving, with due submission to the authority of
the Church, to discover the true meaning of an obscure and
difficult passage, on which the Church has pronounced no
definite judgment. Nor can we be said to make light of the
Word of God, when we are but attempting to defend its unerring
veracity from the assaults of infidel writers. Furthermore
we would add, that, if it is a dangerous thing to modify
the received interpretation of certain parts of Scripture, when
the progress of science enables us to see physical phenomena
under a new light, it is a far more dangerous thing to
persist in imputing to Scripture a doctrine that, in a very
short time, may be proved to be false, beyond the possibility
of contradiction.</p>

<p>These sentiments are not altogether our own. They
have come to us, in great part, from an illustrious Doctor
of the Church; and we are glad, at this early stage of our
discussion, to be able to shelter our humble efforts under
the authority of his venerable name. It is now more than
fourteen centuries and a half since Saint Augustine set
about the literal interpretation of Genesis, which he accomplished
in a Treatise of twelve books. Toward the close
of the first book he expatiates at some length on the difficulty
of his undertaking, and on the variety of diverse interpretations,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
which prevailed even in his time. From this
he takes occasion to warn his readers that, “if we find anything
in Divine Scripture that may be variously explained
without any injury to faith, we should not rush headlong
by positive assertion either to one opinion or the other;
lest, if perchance the opinion we have adopted should afterward
turn out to be false, our faith should fall with it; and
we should be found contending, not so much for the doctrine
of the Sacred Scriptures as for our own; endeavoring
to make our doctrine to be that of the Scriptures, instead
of taking the doctrine of the Scriptures to be ours.”<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> And
a little further on he again exposes the imprudence of such a
proceeding, in words that cannot but be considered peculiarly
applicable to our present subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It often happens that one who is not a Christian hath
some knowledge derived from the clearest arguments or
from the evidence of his senses about the earth, about the
heavens, about the other elements of this world, about the
movements and revolutions, or about the size and distances
of the stars, about certain eclipses of the sun and
moon, about the course of the years and the seasons, about
the nature of animals, plants, and minerals, and about
other things of a like kind. Now it is an unseemly and
mischievous thing, and greatly to be avoided, that a Christian
man speaking on such matters, as if according to the
authority of Christian Scripture, should talk so foolishly
that the unbeliever, on hearing him, and observing the
extravagance of his error, should hardly be able to refrain
from laughing. And the great mischief is, not so much
that the man himself is laughed at for his errors, but that
our authors are believed by people without the Church to
have taught such things, and so are condemned as unlearned,
and cast aside, to the great loss of those for whose
salvation we are so much concerned. For, when they find
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
one belonging to the Christian body falling into error on a
subject with which they themselves are thoroughly conversant,
and when they see him, moreover, enforcing his
groundless opinion by the authority of our Sacred Books,
how are they likely to put trust in these Books about the
resurrection of the dead, and the hope of eternal life, and
the kingdom of heaven, having already come to regard
them as fallacious about those things they had themselves
learned from observation or from unquestionable evidence?
And, indeed, it were not easy to tell what trouble and sorrow
some rash and presumptuous men bring upon their
prudent brethren, who, when they are charged with a perverse
and false opinion by those who do not accept the
authority of our Books, attempt to put forward these same
Holy Books in defence of that which they have lightly and
falsely asserted; sometimes even quoting from memory
what they think will suit their purpose, and putting forth
many words, without well understanding either what they
say, or what they are talking about.”<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<p>And many ages after, Saint Thomas, the great luminary
of the schools, appeals to this wise admonition of Saint
Augustine, and applies it to the circumstances of his own
times. Writing about the work of the Second Day, he says
that “in questions of this sort there are two things to be
observed. First, that the truth of Scripture be inviolably
maintained. Secondly, since Scripture doth admit of
diverse interpretations, that we must not cling to any particular
exposition with such pertinacity, that if what we
supposed to be the teaching of Scripture should afterward
turn out to be clearly false, we should nevertheless still presume
to put it forward; lest thereby we should expose the
Inspired Word of God to the derision of unbelievers, and
shut them out from the way of salvation.”<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></p>

<p>Under the sanction of two such illustrious Saints and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
Doctors we need not hesitate to proceed in our attempt to
reconcile the Inspired narrative of the Creation with the
doctrine of the Antiquity of the Earth, as set forth by the
advocates of Geology. Let it be remembered, however,
that we do not undertake to prove the extreme Antiquity of
the Earth from the language of Scripture; but simply to
show that the language of Scripture leaves the Antiquity of
the Earth an open question. The Geologist holds that this
Globe of ours has been in existence for hundreds of thousands,
perhaps for millions of years; and our object is to
show that, while maintaining this opinion, he may, nevertheless,
accept the historical truth of the Bible narrative.</p>

<p>As before explained, two points arise for discussion:
first, can we suppose an interval of indefinite length to have
elapsed between the Creation of the World, and the work
of the Six Days? and secondly, is it lawful to explain these
Days in the sense of long periods? We shall take these
two questions in succession, dealing with each upon its
own merits; and if we fail to enforce conviction, we hope,
at least, to vindicate our right to toleration.</p>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/t.jpg" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span> opening verses of the Mosaic history may be
rendered thus literally from the Hebrew Text:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) “In the beginning God created the Heavens
and the Earth.</p>

<p>(2) “And the Earth was waste and empty; and darkness
was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God moved
upon the face of the waters.</p>

<p>(3) “And God said, Let there be light; and there was
light.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span></p>

<p>(4) “And God saw the light that it was good; and God
divided the light from the darkness.</p>

<p>(5) “And God called the light Day, and the darkness he
called Night. And the evening was, and the morning was,
the first day.”</p>

<p>Now it appears to us that the great event with which this
narrative begins, the creation of the Heavens and the Earth,
is not represented as a part of the work that was accomplished
within the Six Days. It is not said that <i>on the first day</i>
God created the Heavens and the Earth, but <i>in the beginning</i>.
Besides, the Sacred writer, uniformly throughout the chapter,
employs one and the same peculiar phrase to introduce
the work of each successive day. In describing the operations
of God on the second day, he begins: “<i>And God said</i>,
Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters:” on
the third day, “<i>And God said</i>, Let the waters that are under
the Heavens be gathered together into one place:” on the
fourth, “<i>And God said</i>, Let there be lights in the firmament
of the Heavens to divide the day from the night:” on
the fifth, “<i>And God said</i>, Let the waters bring forth the
creeping thing having life:” on the sixth, “<i>And God said</i>,
Let the earth bring forth the living creature after its kind.”
Hence, when we meet this same phrase for the first time in
the third verse, “<i>And God said</i>, Let there be light,” we may
reasonably suppose that the work of the first day began with
the decree which is set forth in these words. If so it plainly
follows that we may allow the existence of created matter
before that particular epoch of time which, in the language
of Moses, is styled the First Day: for, before the creation of
light, the Heavens and the Earth were already in existence,
and the Earth was waste and empty, and darkness was upon
the face of the deep, and the spirit of God moved upon the
face of the waters.</p>

<p>An objection is sometimes raised from the words of God
in the promulgation of the third commandment:&mdash;“Six
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
days shalt thou labor and do all thy work. But the seventh
day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God; thou shalt do no
work on it.... For <i>in six days the Lord made the
Heavens and the Earth</i> and the sea, and all that is in them,
and resteth the seventh day.”<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> It is argued that the creation
of the Heavens and the Earth is here set forth as a part
of the work accomplished within the Six Days; which is
directly against our opinion. This difficulty would be
simply insurmountable, if it could be proved that the text
refers to that <i>first act of creation</i> by which the Heavens and
the Earth were brought into existence out of nothing. We
think, however, that the phrase may fairly be understood to
mean, in six days the Lord <i>fashioned</i> the Heavens and the
Earth; that is to say, gave to them that form and shape and
outward character which they now possess. In this sense
the words would apply, not to the first act of creation out of
nothing, but rather to that subsequent series of operations
by which the Earth was fitted up and furnished for the use
of man.</p>

<p>And this interpretation is supported by the authority of
our best Commentators. Perrerius formally discusses the
point, and maintains that God may truly be said to have
made the Heavens and the Earth in Six Days, although the
Heavens and the Earth, as far as regards their substantial
matter, had been created before the First Day: for it was
only within the Six Days that they were adorned and completed
and perfected. Tostatus is not less explicit. In this
passage, he says, the word <i>made</i> is very properly employed;
for the Heavens and the Earth which are here referred to,
and the other things that are included under this general
designation, were all <i>made from matter already existing</i>, but
this matter itself was not <i>made</i>, it was <i>created</i>. Petavius also
adopts this view in his remarks upon the fourth verse of the
second chapter of Genesis.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span></p>

<p>We may add that this mode of explaining the passage receives
no small support from the Hebrew text. When it is
said, in the first chapter of Genesis, that “In the beginning
God <i>created</i> the Heavens and the Earth,” the word used by
the Sacred writer is <span class="rtl">ברא</span> (<i>Bara</i>), which strictly means to
create out of nothing; whereas, in describing the operations
of the Six Days, he commonly uses the word <span class="rtl">עשה</span> (<i>Hasah</i>),
which means to <i>form</i> and <i>fashion</i>, or to produce something
out of pre-existing materials.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> Now, in the text of Exodus
we find the word <span class="rtl">עשה</span> (<i>Hasah</i>), to <i>fashion</i> or <i>produce</i>, and
not the word <span class="rtl">ברא</span> (<i>Bara</i>), to <i>create</i>. We do not want to
insist very rigorously upon this distinction between the two
words <span class="rtl">ברא</span> (<i>Bara</i>) and <span class="rtl">עשה</span> (<i>Hasah</i>)), nor would we deny
that they are sometimes interchanged as regards their meaning.
We think they are related to one another pretty nearly
as the corresponding words to <i>create</i> and to <i>make</i> in English,
and we know that the distinction between these two words
is not always strictly observed. Thus, we sometimes say
that God <i>made</i> the world, meaning that he brought it forth
from nothing, and we speak of the <i>creation</i> of peers; and
Shakspeare says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would <i>create</i> soldiers, make our women fight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To doff their dire distresses.”&mdash;<i>Macbeth</i>, Act iv., Sc. iii.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Nevertheless, when we compare two such passages as
these:&mdash;“In the beginning God <i>created</i> the Heavens and the
Earth,” and “In Six Days the Lord <i>made</i> the Heavens and
the Earth and the sea, and all that in them is,” we think the
studied contrast of expression is a fair ground for supposing
that, while the one refers to the Divine decree by which
matter was first brought into existence out of nothing, the
other may be understood of those subsequent operations by
which it received its present form and shape.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span></p>

<p>We see no difficulty, then, as far as the Sacred Text is
concerned, in supposing a condition of created existence
prior to the period of the Six Days. But since this opinion
is the foundation on which our whole argument rests, we
should wish to show, moreover, even at the risk of being
tedious, that it has been put forward and defended by the
most eminent writers in every age of the Church. Amongst
the early Fathers, Saint Basil reasons after this manner
when commenting upon the passage, “There was evening
and there was morning the first day:”&mdash;“The evening is
the common term of day and night; and, in like manner,
the morning is the point of union between night and day.
Wherefore, in order to signify that to the day belonged the
prerogative of being the first begotten, the sacred writer first
commemorates the close of day, and afterward the close of
night; implying thereby that <i>the day was followed by the
night</i>. As to the condition of the world <i>before the formation
of light</i>, that is not called Night, but simply Darkness;
whereas that period which is distinguished from day and
opposed to it, is called night.”<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> This great Doctor, therefore,
teaches that the First Day began with a period of light
which is called day, and ended with a period of darkness
which is called night; and he recognizes a previous state
of existence which was no part of the First Day. So, too,
Saint Chrysostom, in his third Homily upon Genesis, lays
down that the Earth was first created a rude and shapeless
mass, without form or ornament; that <i>afterward</i> light was
made, and that, <i>with the creation of light, the First Day
began</i>.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></p>

<p>In the Western Church, Saint Ambrose adopts the same
line of interpretation. He sets forth that God first created
the world, in the beginning; and afterward during the
Six Days furnished and adorned it; just as a skilful workman
first lays the foundation of a building, and afterward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
raises the superstructure, and superadds the ornament.
And elsewhere, he says that, when the voice of God went
forth, “Let light be made,” in the same moment the First
Day began. It follows, therefore, that the world existed
before the beginning of the First Day. In another place
he gives a new turn to the same idea, telling us that in
the beginning God made the world; and with the world,
time began. But not with time did the First Day begin:
for the First Day is not the beginning of time, it is rather
an epoch of time.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></p>

<p>Passing on to the middle ages, we find our view supported
by the authority of Venerable Bede, in several parts
of his writings. His notion is that, during the Six Days,
God formed and fashioned the world out of shapeless
matter; but, before the Six Days began, He had made
this shapeless matter itself out of nothing. “Two things,”
he says, “did God make before all days, the angelical
nature, and shapeless matter.” And again, he dresses up
this opinion in the form of a dialogue:&mdash;“<i>Disciple.</i> Tell
me the order in which things were made throughout the
Six Days? <i>Master.</i> First, in the very beginning of created
existence, were made heaven and earth, the angels, air,
and water. <i>Disciple.</i> Continue the order of creation?
<i>Master. In the beginning of the First Day</i> light was made;
on the second was made the firmament,” etc.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> Nothing
can be more plain than the distinction here set up between
the beginning of all time, when the Heavens and the Earth
were made, and the beginning of the First Day, when light
was made.</p>

<p>And when we come to still more recent times, we find
this interpretation was taken up and defended by the great
masters in the schools of Theology. Peter Lombard, the
famous Magister Sententiarum, referring to the first verse
of Genesis, says that “in the beginning God created
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
Heaven, which means the Angels, and the Earth, which
means confused and unshapely matter, the same that is
called Chaos by the Greeks; <i>and this was before any day</i>.”
Not less clearly speaks out Hugh of Saint Victor, who for
his profound and varied erudition, was called the second
Augustine. In explaining the history of the Six Days, he
says: “The first of the Divine operations was the creation
of light. But the light was not then created from nothing,
it was formed from pre-existing matter. This was the work
that was accomplished on the First Day: but the material
of this work had been created <i>before the First Day</i>. Directly
with the light the day began; for before the light it was
neither night or day, though time already existed.”<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></p>

<p>Later still, St. Thomas himself clearly leans to this view
when he says: “It is better to maintain that the creation
was before any day.” And Perrerius, the most learned,
perhaps, of all our commentators on Genesis, argues with
us that the world was created before the production of light,
and before the commencement of the First Day. Nay, he
adds that he cannot tell how long that primeval state of
existence may have endured before the Six Days began;
nor does he think it can be known except by a special
revelation. Petavius, too, is with us. He does not indeed
accept our interpretation of the first verse. When it is
said, “In the beginning God created the Heavens and the
Earth,” he holds that these words do not describe any
one particular act of God, but represent, as it were in a
brief summary, the whole work of creation. Thus we are
informed, at the outset, that the Heavens and the Earth as
we see them now are the work of God; and afterward, the
various parts that make up this great whole are described,
and the order in which they were accomplished is set forth.
According to Petavius, then, the creation of the Heavens
and the Earth, recorded in the first verse, was not a distinct
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
act from the operations of the Six Days, but rather includes
them all. Nevertheless, he maintains, as we do, that the
earth, at least, and water, were in existence before the
creation of light; and that, therefore, some period of time
must have elapsed before the beginning of the Six Days.
Furthermore, he says in the same spirit as Perrerius, that
it is beyond our power to conjecture how long that period
may have lasted.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></p>

<p>Our opinion, then, is not open, in the slightest degree,
to the imputation of novelty or singularity. On the contrary,
it would seem rather to reflect the prevailing tradition
of the Church. We think it right, however, to add that
there are great names against us. A Lapide, for instance,
who considers that the Heavens and the Earth were created
at the beginning of the First Day.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> And Tostatus, who
incidentally notices our view, and contents himself with
saying that it is unreasonable. For himself he seems to
waver between two opinions. He thinks the primeval
darkness, described in the second verse, may have been the
night belonging to the First Day; and that during that
night, which probably lasted about twelve hours, we may
suppose the Heavens and the Earth to have been created.
Or else, he says, we may allow that the First Day of the
Mosaic narrative began with the creation of light; but in
that case we must hold that the Heavens and the Earth
were created at the same time with light.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></p>

<p>Saint Augustine, too, we must reluctantly give up; or,
at least, we must be content to regard him as neutral. If
he is not a decided opponent, he is certainly not a consistent
advocate, of our opinion. No doubt he is often quoted
in its favor; and it would be easy to select passages from
his works which seem to enforce it in the plainest terms.
As for example: “In the beginning, O my God, <i>before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
any day</i>, Thou didst make the Heavens and the Earth.”<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a>
But, in truth, this opinion is utterly irreconcilable with the
well known and very singular teaching of Saint Augustine
concerning the creation of the world. He held that all the
great works recounted in the first chapter of Genesis were,
in fact, accomplished in a single instant. There was no
real succession, according to him, in the order of time,
between the production of the Heavens and the Earth, of
light and the firmament, of the sun, moon, and stars,
of plants, trees, and animals. In one and the same instant
of time all these came into existence together. As to the
description given by Moses, it is accommodated to the
capacity of a rude people; and the succession there set
forth is intended only to exhibit the several parts of a great
whole, in the manner best suited to the conceptions of
human intelligence.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></p>

<p>This view of the creation is repeated again and again by
Saint Augustine in his numerous works upon Genesis, and
illustrated in diverse ways, so as to leave no doubt that he
held it deliberately and persistently. With regard to such
passages as that quoted above, in which he says that God
created the Heavens and the Earth <i>before any day</i>, it may
be maintained that Saint Augustine was not always consistent
with himself, and that he held different opinions at
different times; or even that he put forward opposite opinions
at the same time, not setting them forth as true, but
only as possible and legitimate.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></p>

<p>We think, however, that his consistency, in this case at
least, can be defended, and that he has himself sufficiently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
explained in what sense he wished these passages to be
understood. He tells us that we must distinguish two
kinds of succession: succession in the order of time, and
succession in the order of our conceptions. Thus, for example,
in the order of time there is no succession between
the sound of the voice in singing and the musical note
that is sung: the sound is, in fact, the note, and the note
is the sound. But in the order of our conceptions we first
apprehend a thing according to its substance, and then according
to its qualities. We first conceive the sound itself,
as a sound, and then we conceive it as having that peculiar
quality which makes it a musical note. Such as this is the
succession Saint Augustine seems to admit in the order of
the creation. He tells us, no doubt, that God first created
shapeless matter, and afterward gave to it form and beauty:
and certainly this statement, if standing alone, would, according
to the ordinary use of language, imply a real succession
in the order of time. But then, a little further on,
he expressly repudiates the idea of a succession in point of
time, and says that the priority he ascribes to shapeless
matter is only a priority in the order of our conceptions.
We must first conceive matter to exist before we can conceive
it to have this or that particular form; and the Inspired
Writer follows the order of our conceptions, in order
to adapt his narrative to the mental feebleness of our present

<p>With the truth or falsehood of these views we are not
concerned just now. We have dwelt upon them rather
from an honest desire of showing that Saint Augustine is
not so clearly on our side in this question, as might be
supposed from some isolated passages of his writings. He
says indeed that the world was created before light, and
before the beginning of the First Day; but then again he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
tells us that this is only a way of speaking, and that, in
reality, all things were created together.</p>

<p>But although these high authorities&mdash;A Lapide, Tostatus,
Saint Augustine&mdash;and some others less illustrious
than these, are unfavorable to our interpretation, we think
it is supported by a preponderance of the best interpreters,
both in ancient and modern times. At all events, with
such an array of venerable names as we have been able to
bring forward in its behalf,&mdash;and they are but a few chosen
out of many,&mdash;no one can deny that we are fairly entitled
to hold it without any note of censure, without any suspicion
of Theological error. Setting out, then, from this
point, that there was a state of created existence prior to
the Six Days of the Mosaic history, the question naturally
arises, how long did that state of existence endure? Was
it for an hour? a day? a week? a month? a century? a
million of years? We cannot tell. To these questions
the Sacred Text gives no reply. It simply records that in
the beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth, and
that, at some subsequent epoch of time, His decree again
went forth, Let there be light, and light there was. One
thing, however, is plain, that, if this period existed at all,
it might just as well have lasted a hundred millions of years
as a hundred seconds. It would be folly to attempt to
measure the succession of God’s acts, when he does please
to produce effects in succession, according to our petty
standards of time. “One day with the Lord is as a thousand
years, and a thousand years as one day.”<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<p>And it is not a little remarkable that, long before the
discoveries of Geology had suggested any necessity for
allowing the lapse of many ages between the first creation
of the world and the creation of man, the sagacity of our
commentators led them to observe that the duration of this
interval is left undefined in the Sacred Record. “How
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
long that interval may have lasted,” says Petavius, “it is
absolutely impossible to conjecture.” And Perrerius, as we
have seen, declared that it could not be known except by a
special revelation. And five centuries earlier, at the very
dawn of Scholastic Theology, Hugh of Saint Victor raised
the same question, and expressed his opinion that it could
not be solved from Scripture. Citing the passage, In the
beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth, he
says, “From these words it is plain that in the beginning
of time, or rather with time itself, the original matter of all
things came into existence. But how long it remained in
this confused and unshapely condition the Scripture clearly
does not tell us.”<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></p>

<p>We may go further still. If we are at liberty to admit
an interval of indefinite length between the creation of the
world and the work of the Six Days, there is certainly
nothing which forbids us to suppose that, during this
period, the earth should have undergone many revolutions,
and have been peopled by countless tribes of plants and
animals, which, as age rolled on after age, came into existence,
and died out, and were succeeded by new creations.
We cannot, perhaps, see the use of all this, nor can
we penetrate the motives the Great Creator might have had
in bringing into existence such a boundless profusion of
organic life. Granted: but then we have studied the
Sacred Text to little purpose if we have not yet realized the
solemn truth that, to our poor and feeble intellects, His
judgments are incomprehensible, and his ways unsearchable.
Did He not set His stars in the remotest regions of
space, far beyond the reach of unaided human vision, and
did they not shine there for ages, though man could see
them not? And for ages, too, did not the wild flowers
spring up, and bloom, and decay, in many a fair and
favored spot of this beautiful Earth, where there was none to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
admire their splendor, none to inhale their sweetness? Then
again, look at that marvellous kingdom of minute animalcules,
in number almost infinite, which only within the
last few years the microscope has revealed to our wondering
eyes. They swarm around us in the air, in the earth,
in the water. Millions of them would fit in the hollow of
your hand; many hundreds might swim side by side,
without crowding, through the eye of a cambric needle.
And they too, we can hardly doubt, must have flourished
for centuries in countless myriads, unseen and unknown by
man. It is impossible for us, in our present imperfect
state, to understand the motives of an All-wise Creator in
this profuse expenditure of his goodness, this lavish display
of His power. How then can we presume to say that He
may not have good reasons, though inscrutable to us, for
peopling this Earth with many tribes of plants and animals,
through a long cycle of ages, before it pleased Him to fit
it up for the habitation of man? “Who is he among men
that can know the counsel of God? or who can find out
His designs? For the judgments of mortal men are hesitating,
and uncertain are our thoughts. For the corruptible
body is a load upon the soul, and the earthly dwelling
presseth down the mind that museth upon many things.
And hardly do we guess aright at things that are upon
earth: and with labor do we find the things that are before
us. But the things that are in heaven who shall search
out?”<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></p>

<p>We have heard it sometimes objected that plants and
animals could not have existed without light; and that
light was not created until the beginning of the First Mosaic
Day. Many curious and interesting facts are adduced
in support of this argument. For example, we are reminded
that certain Fossil animals belonging to the earliest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
Geological Periods, are shown by the clearest evidence, to
have had eyes constructed on the same optical principles,
and accommodated to the same optical conditions, as the eyes
of those animals that have flourished on the Earth during
the period of history: and such eyes, it is contended,
plainly import the existence of light. The answer to this
objection may be stated in a very few words. We freely
admit that the hypothesis we have been defending would
be of little use to account for Geological phenomena, if it
did not include the existence of light, during that Period of
indefinite duration which we suppose to have elapsed between
the first creation of the world and the work of the
Six Days. But in truth there is no difficulty in supposing
that, during such an interval, light may have prevailed upon
the earth, and air, and all the other conditions of organic
life, pretty much as they do at the present day. Afterward,
at the close of the period, when, perhaps, ages innumerable
had rolled by, this planet of ours would have appeared
in that condition which is described in the second verse of
Genesis: “And the earth was waste and empty, and darkness
was upon the face of the deep.” Then the command
of God would have gone forth, “Let there be light:” and
at once the darkness would have been dispelled, a new era
of existence would have commenced, and the Earth would
forthwith have been set in order and furnished, in a special
manner, for the habitation of man.</p>

<p>Even as regards the Sun, Moon, and Stars, they too may
have existed before the work of the Six Days began. We
read, no doubt, that on the Fourth Day, God said, “Let
there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to divide the
day from the night:” and a little farther on it is added that
“God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the
day, and the lesser light to rule the night; and the stars.”
But then it must be remembered that some of our best
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
Commentators, without any reference to Geology, have
taught that, before this command was given, the heavenly
bodies were already in existence for three days, and were
already discharging the office of dividing day and night.
They explain the passage by saying that the Sun, Moon,
and Stars, are represented as having been made on the
Fourth Day, not because they were then produced for the first
time out of nothing, but because the vapors by which they
had been obscured were, on that Day, dissipated, and they
began to shine visibly in the Firmament of Heaven. If
this line of interpretation is admissible, and it seems to us not
unreasonable, then we are certainly at liberty to hold, consistently
with the Mosaic narrative, that the Heavenly bodies
may have been created with the Heavens and the Earth in
the beginning of all time; and that on the Fourth Day
they were made manifest in the Firmament to rule over the
day and the night, and to regulate the course of the years
and the seasons.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></p>

<p>Again it is urged against our hypothesis that Moses could
not have passed over in complete silence such a long and
eventful era in the history of the world. Certainly not, we
admit, if he professed to write a complete history of the
Earth and all its revolutions. But this was not his purpose.
Every book, whether sacred or profane, must be
examined and interpreted according to the end for which
it was designed. Now the end and scope of the Book of
Genesis was not to instruct mankind about the movements
of the heavenly bodies, or the physical changes of the
Earth’s surface, or the laws which govern the material universe.
It was, first of all, to impress on the minds of the
Jewish people that this world of ours is the work of one
only God, distinct from all creatures, and Himself the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
Creator of sun, moon, and stars, and of every other object
which pagan nations were wont to worship: and in the
next place, to set forth, briefly and simply, the story of
God’s dealings with man in the first ages of the human
race. Whatever we may hold, therefore, about the revolutions
and changes of the Earth’s surface previous to the
work of the Six Days, it is plain that the history of these
phenomena did not appertain to the object which the
Sacred writer had in view. Consequently he cannot
be said, by the omission of these events, to lead
his readers into error; he simply allows them to remain
in ignorance. What it was his purpose to tell, he tells
truly: what did not belong to his purpose, he passes by in
silence.</p>

<p>But it is further argued that this long interval of time we
have been contending for, is incompatible with the use of
the copulative conjunction, by which the several clauses of
the narrative are connected together. The Sacred text runs
thus:&mdash;“In the beginning God created the Heavens and
the Earth. <i>And</i> the Earth was waste and empty: and darkness
was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God
moved upon the face of the waters. <i>And</i> God said, Let there
be light; and there was light.” Is it possible, we are asked,
to admit a period of indefinite length between events thus
closely linked together? Our answer is that, according to
the idiom of the Hebrew language, the conjunction <span class="rtl">וְ</span> or <span class="rtl">ו&#x5b8;</span> (<i>ve</i>
or <i>va</i>), which is here employed, while it serves to connect
together the clauses of a narrative, does not of necessity
imply the immediate succession of the events recorded.
The very wide and indefinite signification which belongs
to this little particle is well known to all who are
familiar with the Hebrew text. It is sometimes copulative,
sometimes adversative, sometimes disjunctive, sometimes
causal. Very frequently it is used simply for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
purpose of <i>continuing the discourse</i>;<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> and this we believe is
the true force of the word in the passage under discussion.</p>

<p>An example very much to the point occurs in the Book
of Numbers, twentieth chapter and first verse:&mdash;“<i>And</i> the
children of Israel, the whole congregation came into the
desert of Sin.” Here the narrative opens with the connecting
particle <span class="rtl">ויבואו בני ישראל כל העדה&mdash;:ו</span>. And yet
the reader will find, if he carefully examine the passage, that
the event thus introduced by the sacred writer was separated
by a period of eight-and-thirty years from those which had
been related in the preceding chapter. This conjunction,
therefore, does not exclude an interval of eight-and-thirty
years between the events which it links together in history.
And that being so, there is no good reason for supposing
that it should, of necessity, exclude an interval of indefinite
length.</p>

<p>The Weakness of this objection may be made even more
strikingly manifest by an inspection of the opening words in
the first chapter of Ezechiel:&mdash;<span class="rtl">ריהי בשלשים שנה</span>. So
little did the notion prevail that the conjunction ו (<i>ve</i>) could
be used only to connect together events closely associated in
point of time, that here it actually <i>begins</i> the narrative, and
is, in fact, the first word of the whole book. In the Douay
version the passage is not inaptly rendered after this manner:
“Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth
month, on the fifth day of the month, when I was in the
midst of the captives by the River Chobar, the heavens were
opened, and I saw the visions of God.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have now brought to a conclusion the first part of
our inquiry. We have endeavored to show that there is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
nothing in Scripture or Tradition which forbids us to admit
a long interval of time between the Creation of the world
and the work of the Six Days. It remains to examine what
was the nature of these Six Days themselves. Were they, as
Saint Augustine maintained, one single indivisible instant
of time? or were they days of twenty-four hours, as is more
commonly supposed? or were they simply periods of time
of which the duration is left wholly undetermined in the
Sacred Text?</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">No</span> one who will take the trouble to investigate, with
any reasonable diligence and research, the nature of
the Mosaic Days, can fail to be struck with the remarkable
diversity of opinion that existed on the subject
among the early Fathers of the Church. Yet this diversity of
opinion is often overlooked by modern writers. They fancy
that the meaning of the word Day is so plain as to leave no
room for doubt or controversy; that a day can be nothing
else than a period of twenty-four hours, marked by the succession
of light and darkness; and that in this sense the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
Mosaic narrative was universally understood until quite
recently, when a new explanation was invented, to meet the
requirements of modern science. All this is far from true.
The meaning of the Mosaic Days has been, in point of fact,
a subject of controversy from the earliest times. And Saint
Augustine tells us that the question appeared to him so
difficult that he could pronounce no decisive judgment
upon it. “As to these Days,” he says, “what kind they
were, it is very difficult, nay, it is impossible to imagine, and
much more so to explain.”<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, this great Doctor, having long pondered
over the subject, and considered it on many sides, does not
hesitate to express his own opinion. And he departs very
widely, indeed, from the literal and obvious interpretation.
He maintains, at great length,<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> as we had before occasion
to observe, that God created all things in a single instant
of time, according to the words of Ecclesiasticus, “He
who liveth forever created all things at once.”<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> Thus he
is led to infer that the Six Days commemorated by Moses
were, in reality, but one day; and this not such a day as
those which are now measured by the revolution of the
sun, for we find three successive days recorded by Moses
before the sun appeared in the Heavens. It was, in fact,
nothing else than that one single instant of time in which
all things were created together.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p>

<p>Nor was this opinion peculiar to Saint Augustine. At
the very dawn of the Christian Era it was set forth by Philo
the Jew; and afterward it was maintained by Clement of
Alexandria, and by Origen. The great Saint Athanasius
seems to throw the weight of his authority in the same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
direction, when he says, speaking of the Creation, that
“no one thing was made before another, but all things
were produced at once together by the self-same command.”
And after the time of Saint Augustine this figurative interpretation
was defended by Saint Eucherius, Bishop of
Lyons, in the course of the fifth century, and by Procopius
of Gaza in the sixth. In the days of the schools we find it
approved by Albertus Magnus, and treated respectfully by
Saint Thomas; and later still, adopted by Cardinal Cajetan,
in his commentary on the Book of Genesis.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></p>

<p>It will be said, perhaps, that we are here arguing against
ourselves: these eminent writers are in favor of reducing the
days of Creation to one single point of time; whereas it
is our purpose to stretch them out to periods of indefinite
length. But no: our object just now is not precisely
to establish our own hypothesis, but rather to prepare
the way for its discussion. We want to show that we
are quite free to abandon the popular view of the Mosaic
Days if there be good reason for our doing so. And it
seems to us that we have abundantly established this point
by a long list of eminent ecclesiastical writers, who, without
any note of censure, have diverged very widely from
the common interpretation. No doubt they have shortened
the time, and we want to lengthen it. But in this they
agree with us, that the days of Creation are not of necessity
days in the ordinary sense of the word. Nay, Saint Augustine
goes farther, and maintains, from the evidence of the
Sacred Text itself, that they cannot be understood in this
sense.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></p>

<p>Having thus cleared away a serious difficulty that seemed
to obstruct our path, we may proceed without hesitation to
the direct object of our inquiry. The burden of proof, let
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
it be remembered, is not with us, but rather with those who
contend for Days of twenty-four hours. They must prove
that this word Day in the first chapter of Genesis means a
period of twenty-four hours, and <i>can mean nothing else</i>. If
it <i>may</i> be understood in a wider sense, consistently with the
usage of Scripture, that is quite enough for us. We are
perfectly at liberty to adopt an interpretation which, on the
one hand, the Sacred Text fairly admits, and on the other,
the discoveries of Natural Science would seem to demand.
Let us examine, then, the arguments that are usually
adduced in favor of the popular interpretation.</p>

<p>Throughout the first chapter of Genesis the Hebrew
word <span class="rtl">יוֺם</span> (<i>yom</i>) is everywhere employed by Moses to designate
the Days of Creation. And many writers contend
that the use of this word is, in itself, evidence enough that
he spoke of days in the common sense of the term. It is
plain, they say, from the usage of Scripture, that the
word <span class="rtl">יוֺם</span> (<i>yom</i>) had a fixed and certain meaning in the
Hebrew language; the same precisely as that which we now
attach to the English word Day. Sometimes, when contra-distinguished
from night, it was applied to the period of
light, from sunrise to sunset; otherwise, it meant the civil
day of twenty-four hours, measured by the revolution of
the Sun. Moreover, it had unquestionably attained this
meaning at the time when Moses wrote, and therefore it
could not have been employed by him in any other sense.</p>

<p>This argument rests upon a false foundation. It is true,
no doubt, that the word <span class="rtl">יוֺם</span> (<i>yom</i>) was more usually employed
in one or other of the two senses just explained;&mdash;that
is to say, (1) for the period of light from sunrise to
sunset, or (2) for the period of twenty-four hours corresponding
to a complete revolution of the Sun. But, for
the validity of the argument, it would be necessary to show
that, beside these two senses, there is no other in which the
word may be fairly understood, conformably to the usage
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
of the Hebrew language. Now this has never yet been
proved. On the contrary, the Scripture affords abundant
evidence that the word <span class="rtl">יוֺם</span> (<i>yom</i>) had a third meaning
quite different from the other two; that it was freely used
to designate a period of time much longer than a common
day, and generally of uncertain and indefinite duration. A
few examples will be interesting, we hope, to our readers.</p>

<p>In the second chapter of Genesis, Moses, having completed
his account of the Creation, says (v. 4): “These
are the generations of the Heavens and the Earth when
they were created, in the <i>Day</i> (<span class="rtl">יוֺם</span>, <i>yom</i>) that the Lord
God created the Earth and the Heavens: (v. 5), and every
plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb
of the field before it grew.” There is a good deal of controversy
about the precise meaning of this passage. But
one thing at least appears to be plain, that the word <span class="rtl">יוֺם</span>
(<i>yom</i>), is not used to designate a day of twenty-four hours;
nor yet the period of light from sunrise to sunset; but
rather the whole period of the Creation.</p>

<p>On this point almost all our best commentators are
agreed. “It is manifest,” says Venerable Bede, “that in
this place the sacred writer has put the word Day for all
that time during which the primeval creation was brought
into existence. For it was not upon any one of the Six
Days that the sky was made and adorned with stars, and
the dry land was separated from the waters, and furnished
with trees and plants. But, <i>according to its accustomed
practice</i>, Scripture here uses the word day in the sense of
time.” Saint Augustine gives even a wider expansion to
the word when he writes: “Seven Days are enumerated
above, and now that is called one Day in which God made
the Heavens and the Earth, and every green thing of the
field; by which term we may well suppose that <i>all time is
meant</i>. For God then made all time when He made
creatures that live in time; and these creatures are here
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
signified by the Heavens and the Earth.” Molina on the
same passage says: “Learned writers tell us commonly
that Moses in this place puts the word Day in the sense of
Time, just as in the passage of Deuteronomy, ‘The day of
perdition is at hand.’... And elsewhere in Scripture Day
is often used for Time.” Bannez, too, concurs in this
opinion. “The word Day,” he says, “can be understood
<i>for any duration whatsoever</i>.” Perrerius, answering an
objection taken from this text, says that “Day is put for
Time, as is <i>frequently done in Scripture</i>.” And Petavius
not only adopts this interpretation, but contends that it is
conformable to the usage even of the Greek and Latin
writers. He gives an example from Cicero against Verres:
“Itaque cum ego <i>diem</i> in Siciliam perexiguam postulavissem,
invenit iste qui sibi in Achaiam <i>biduo breviorem diem</i>
postularet.”<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> Here, then, is an instance in which Moses
himself uses the word Day (<span class="rtl">יוֺם</span>, <i>yom</i>) not in the ordinary
sense, but for a long period of time;&mdash;for all that time,
whatever it may have been, which elapsed from the first
act of creation to the close of the Six Days.</p>

<p>Another striking example occurs in the prophet Amos.
“Behold, the days are coming, saith the Lord God, and I
will send forth a famine into the land: not a famine of
bread, nor a thirst of water, but of hearing the word of the
Lord. And they shall wander from sea to sea and from
the north to the east; they shall go about seeking the
word of the Lord, and shall not find it. In that <i>day</i> (<span class="rtl">יוֺם</span>
<i>yom</i>) shall the fair virgins and the young men faint for
thirst.”<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> Every one will see at a glance that the word Day
in the latter part of this passage does not mean a day of
twenty-four hours. It evidently refers to the whole period
during which the calamities here foretold were to be inflicted
on the Jewish people. What that period was may be a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
question of dispute. By some it is taken for the time
of the Babylonian captivity; by others, for the present age
of the world, in which the Jews are wanderers on the face
of the earth, without a prophet and without a pastor, thirsting
for the word of God, and seeking it in vain. But, in
any case, it is clear from the opening words: “Behold, the
days are coming,” that it was a period not of one day only,
but of many.</p>

<p>Then we have those well known words addressed by
God the Father to His Eternal Son: “Thou art my Son,
this <i>day</i> (<span class="rtl">יוֺם</span>, <i>yom</i>) have I begotten thee.”<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> The Son of
God was begotten of the Father before all ages; and the
<i>day</i>, therefore, on which he was begotten, cannot be a
common day of twenty-four hours, but must rather be the
long day of Eternity, without beginning and without end.</p>

<p>This text, we know, is sometimes applied to the day of
our Lord’s Resurrection; and sometimes, too, to the day
of His Incarnation: nor do we want to deny that it may be
thus rightly explained in a secondary and mystical sense.
But in its literal sense we think it plainly refers to the
Eternal Generation of the Son. This meaning is sufficiently
implied by the word <i>begotten</i>, which cannot be understood
with propriety, except of that Generation by virtue of
which our Divine Lord was from Eternity the natural Son
of God. Moreover, this is the sense in which the passage
is adopted by Saint Paul in his Epistle to the Hebrews.
Wishing to show that Our Lord has received by inheritance
a name more excellent than any given to the Angels, he
argues thus: “For to which of the Angels hath he said at
any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten
thee?”<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> Now it seems to us that, unless we understand
these words of the Eternal Generation, the point of the
Apostle’s argument is completely lost. The Angels are
sometimes called in Scripture the sons of God; but they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
were only the <i>adopted sons</i>, whereas Our Lord was the
<i>natural Son</i> in virtue of His Eternal Generation. Consequently
it was no other than the Eternal Generation which
made the name of Son more excellent when applied to
Christ than the same name when applied to the angels.</p>

<p>Again, it is quite a common thing, with the prophets
generally, to use the word <span class="rtl">יוֺם</span> (<i>yom</i>) for the season of tribulation
and affliction, though the same may have extended
over a period of many days or even many years. Jeremias
employs it in this sense when he describes so vividly the
manifold calamities that were impending over the ill-fated
Babylon. “I have caused thee to fall into a snare,
and thou art taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware
of it: thou art found and caught because thou hast provoked
the Lord. The Lord hath opened His armory,
and hath brought forth the weapons of his wrath: for the
Lord the God of hosts hath a work to be done in the land
of the Chaldeans. Come ye against her from the uttermost
borders: open, that they may go forth that shall tread her
down: take the stones out of the way, and make heaps,
and destroy her: and let nothing of her be left. Destroy
all her valiant men, let them go down to the slaughter:
woe to them, for their <i>day</i> (<span class="rtl">יוֺם</span>, <i>yom</i>) is come, <i>the time</i> of
their visitation. The voice of them that flee, and of them
that have escaped out of the land of Babylon: to declare
in Sion the revenge of the Lord our God, the revenge of
His temple. Declare to many against Babylon, to all that
bend the bow: stand together against her round about, and
let none escape; pay her according to her work: according
to all that she hath done, do ye to her: for she hath lifted
up herself against the Lord, against the Holy One of Israel.
Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets: and all
her men of war shall hold their peace in that <i>day</i> (<span class="rtl">יוֺם</span>, <i>yom</i>),
saith the Lord. Behold I come against thee, O proud one,
saith the Lord the God of hosts: for the <i>day</i> (<span class="rtl">יוֺם</span>, <i>yom</i>) is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
come, the <i>time</i> of thy visitation. And the proud one shall
fall, he shall fall down, and there shall be none to lift him
up: and I will kindle afire in his cities, and it shall
devour all round about him.”<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> And in the following
chapter:&mdash;“Thus saith the Lord: Behold, I will raise up
as it were a pestilential wind against Babylon, and against
the inhabitants thereof who have lifted up their heart against
me. And I will send to Babylon fanners, and they shall
fan her, and shall destroy her land: for they are come
upon her on every side in the <i>day</i> (<span class="rtl">יוֺם</span>, <i>yom</i>) of her
affliction.”<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></p>

<p>In another place the same prophet applies the word <span class="rtl">יוֺם</span>
(<i>yom</i>) to the whole duration of a long campaign carried on
by Nabuchodonosor against Pharao Nechao, king of Egypt.
“Prepare ye the shield and buckler, and go forth to
battle. Harness the horses, and get up, ye horsemen:
stand forth with helmets, furbish the spears, put on coats
of mail. What then? I have seen them dismayed, and
turning their backs, their valiant ones slain: they fled
apace, they looked not back: terror was round about, saith
the Lord. Let not the swift flee away, nor the strong
think to escape: they are overthrown and fallen down,
toward the north by the river Euphrates. Who is this that
cometh up as a flood: and his streams swell like those of
rivers? Egypt riseth up like a flood, and the waves thereof
shall be moved as rivers, and he shall say: I will go up
and will cover the earth: I will destroy the city and its inhabitants.
Get ye up on horses, and glory in chariots,
and let the valiant men come forth, the Ethiopians and the
Lybians, that handle the shield, and the Lydians that
handle and bend the bow. For this is the <i>day</i> (<span class="rtl">יוֺם</span>, <i>yom</i>)
of the Lord the God of hosts, a <i>day</i> of vengeance that He
may revenge Himself of His enemies: the sword shall devour,
and shall be filled, and shall be drunk with their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
blood: for there is a sacrifice of the Lord God of hosts in
the north country, by the river Euphrates.... Furnish
thyself to go into captivity, thou daughter inhabitant of
Egypt: for Memphis shall be made desolate, and shall be
forsaken and uninhabited. Egypt is like a fair and beautiful
heifer: there shall come from the north one that shall
goad her. Her hirelings also that lived in the midst of
her, like fatted calves are turned back, and are fled away
together, and they could not stand: for the <i>day</i> (<span class="rtl">יוֺם</span>, <i>yom</i>)
of their slaughter is come upon them, the <i>time</i> of their
visitation.”<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></p>

<p>The prophet Ezechiel, too, furnishes a forcible illustration
when he thus foreshadows the course of a second expedition
against Egypt undertaken by the same prince:&mdash;
“Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will set
Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon in the land of Egypt:
and he shall take her multitude, and take the booty thereof
for a prey, and rifle the spoils thereof: and it shall be
wages for his army; and for the service he hath done me
against it: I have given him the land of Egypt, because he
hath labored for me, saith the Lord God. In that <i>day</i>
(<span class="rtl">יוֺם</span>, <i>yom</i>) a horn shall bud forth for the house of Israel,
and I will give thee an open mouth in the midst of them:
and they shall know that I am the Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> And a little
further on:&mdash;“For the <i>day</i> (<span class="rtl">יוֺם</span>, <i>yom</i>) is near, yea the <i>day</i>
of the Lord is near: a cloudy <i>day</i>, it shall be the <i>time</i> of
the nations. And the sword shall come upon Egypt: and
there shall be dread in Ethiopia, when the wounded shall
fall in Egypt, and the multitude thereof shall be taken
away, and the foundations thereof shall be destroyed.
Ethiopia and Lybia, and Lydia, and all the rest of the
crowd, and Chub, and the children of the land of the covenant,
shall fall with them by the sword.... And they
shall know that I am the Lord: when I shall have set a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
fire in Egypt, and all the helpers thereof shall be destroyed.
In that <i>day</i> (<span class="rtl">יוֺם</span>, <i>yom</i>), shall messengers go forth from my
face in ships to destroy the confidence of Ethiopia, and
there shall be dread among them in that <i>day</i> (<span class="rtl">יוֺם</span>, <i>yom</i>) of
Egypt: because it shall certainly come.”<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></p>

<p>Once more, this word is applied to the period of Our
Lord’s life upon earth, and even to the whole duration of
the Christian Church. Sophonias, for example, thus foretells
the coming of the kingdom of Christ. “Wherefore
expect me, saith the Lord, in the day of my resurrection
that is to come, for my judgment is to assemble the Gentiles,
and to gather the kingdoms.... From beyond the
rivers of Ethiopia shall my suppliants, the children of my
dispersed people, bring me an offering. In that <i>day</i> (<span class="rtl">יוֺם</span>,
<i>yom</i>) thou shalt not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein
thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away
out of the midst of thee thy proud boasters, and thou shalt
no more be lifted up because of my holy mountain....
Give praise, O daughter of Sion: shout, O Israel: be glad
and rejoice with all thy heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.
The Lord hath taken away thy judgment, he hath turned
away thy enemies: the King of Israel the Lord is in the
midst of thee, thou shalt fear evil no more. In that <i>day</i>
(<span class="rtl">יוֺם</span>, <i>yom</i>) it shall be said to Jerusalem: Fear not; to Sion:
Let not thy hands be weakened. The Lord thy God in the
midst of thee is mighty, He will save: He will rejoice over
thee with gladness, He will be silent in His love, He will
be joyful over thee in praise.”<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<p>And Isaias: “Is it not yet a very little while, and Libanon
shall be turned into a charmel, and charmel shall be
esteemed as a forest? And in that <i>day</i> (<span class="rtl">יוֺם</span>, <i>yom</i>) the deaf
shall hear the words of the book, and out of darkness and
obscurity the eyes of the blind shall see. And the meek
shall increase their joy in the Lord, and the poor men shall
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.”<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> That this passage
refers to the time of the Christian Church there can be no
doubt; for our Lord himself appeals to it in proof of His
divine mission: “Go and relate to John what you have
heard and seen. The blind see, the lame walk, the lepers
are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead rise again, the poor
have the Gospel preached to them.”<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></p>

<p>We may trace this use of the word even in the New
Testament. Our Lord says, arguing with the Jews: “Abraham
your father rejoiced that he might see my <i>day</i>: he saw it
and was glad.”<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> Saint Paul, too, though writing in the
Greek language to the Corinthians, does not hesitate to
adopt a passage from Isaias, in which the same meaning is
conspicuously brought out: “And we helping do exhort
you, that you receive not the grace of God in vain. For
he saith: In an accepted time have I heard thee, and in the
<i>day</i> of salvation have I helped thee. Behold, now is the
<i>acceptable time</i>: behold, now is the <i>day of salvation</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> And
finally, Our Divine Lord, in His last touching address to
the city of Jerusalem, applies the word <i>day</i> to the season of
grace and mercy: “When he drew near, seeing the city,
He wept over it, saying: If thou also hadst known, and that
in this thy <i>day</i>, the things that are to thy peace: but now they
are hidden from thy eyes. For the days shall come upon
thee; and thy enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and
compass thee round, and straiten thee on every side.”<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></p>

<p>So much, then, for the first argument. From the numerous
examples we have given it is plain enough that the
word <span class="rtl">יוֺם</span> (<i>yom</i>), in Scripture language, was often used for
a period of many days, and even many years; nay sometimes
for a period of many centuries. If so, Moses was free
to use it in this sense. And consequently, as far as the
word itself is concerned, it affords no conclusive proof that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
the Days of Creation were days of twenty-four hours only:
we may hold them to belong and indefinite periods of time,
without departing in any degree from the established usage
of Scripture.</p>

<p>But it is urged&mdash;and this is the second argument,&mdash;that,
whatever may be the meaning of the word <span class="rtl">יוֺם</span> (<i>yom</i>) elsewhere,
in the first chapter of Genesis it must mean a day of
twenty-four hours. For we are not merely told that there
was a First Day, and a Second Day, and a Third Day; but
each day is in a manner analyzed by the sacred writer, and
its component parts set forth for our instruction. <i>There
was evening and there was morning</i>, he says, the First Day;
<i>there was evening and there was morning</i> the Second Day;
<i>there was evening and there was morning</i> the Third Day; and
so on. Now if the word were understood of those indefinite
periods we have been speaking about, there would be no
meaning in this analysis: for it could hardly be maintained
that each of those periods had but one evening and one
morning like an ordinary day. Furthermore, it is argued
that there is a peculiar appropriateness in this phrase, which
goes far to confirm the common interpretation. Amongst
the Jews it was usual to compute the civil day from sunset
to sunset. The civil day began then with the evening. And
accordingly Moses, in describing the Days of Creation,
puts the evening first, and says: There was evening and
there was morning the First Day; there was evening and
there was morning the Second Day; and so for the rest.</p>

<p>All this reasoning seems to us unsatisfactory and inconclusive.
In the first place, it is not a fact, as would seem
to be supposed, that the civil day is made up of evening and
morning. The evening and the morning do not make the
whole day; they are only certain periods of the day. Neither
do they mark the limits of the day: for, though it is quite
true that, in the computation of the Jews, the civil day began
with the evening, it certainly did not end with the morning.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
If, then, by the word Day, Moses here meant the civil
day of twenty-four hours, how is this clause to be understood,
There was evening and there was morning the First
Day? It cannot mean that the evening and the morning
put together made up the First Day: for this is not a fact.
It cannot mean that the evening marked the beginning of
the day, and the morning marked its close: for the period
included between the evening and the morning is not the
day but the night. What does it mean, then?</p>

<p>Many writers seem to suppose that the evening and the
morning are intended by Moses to designate the night and
the day;&mdash;that is to say, the whole period of darkness and
the whole period of light, which put together make up
the civil day of twenty-four hours. If the text could be
explained in this way, it would fit in, no doubt, much more
appropriately with the theory of ordinary days than with the
theory of indefinite periods. But the text <i>cannot</i> be explained
in this way. The evening is <i>not</i> the whole period
of darkness, and the morning is <i>not</i> the whole period of
light. No English writer could say, with propriety, that the
Day is made up of the evening and the morning. Neither
could Moses have meant to say this in the first chapter of
Genesis: for the Hebrew words <span class="rtl">ערב</span> (<i>Ghereb</i>) <i>and</i> <span class="rtl">בקר</span> (<i>Boker</i>)
which are found in the original text, have a meaning not
less fixed and definite than the corresponding words Evening
and the Morning in the English language.</p>

<p>To prove the truth of this assertion by an investigation
of all the passages in the Hebrew Bible, in which these
words are found, would be a tedious and uninteresting
task. But it may be easily tested in another way. If the
words <span class="rtl">ערב</span> (<i>Ghereb</i>) and <span class="rtl">בקר</span> (<i>Boker</i>) were ever used to
mean, not strictly the evening and morning, but the whole
period of night and the whole period of day, this fact would
surely have become known in the course of time to some of
the many eminent and accomplished Hebrew lexicographers.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
We ask, then, is there one Hebrew lexicon of note which
assigns the sense of <i>night</i> to the word <span class="rtl">ערב</span> (<i>Ghereb</i>) and the
sense of <i>day</i> to the word <span class="rtl">בקר</span> (<i>Boker</i>). For ourselves, we
have searched several of the best of them, and we have not
found a single one that even hints at such an explanation.</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, some of our readers might be unwilling
to accept the authority of lexicons as conclusive on a
point of this kind; seeing that lexicons very often represent
but imperfectly the full power of a language. Well,
then, there is another process, and a simple one enough,
by which they may demonstrate the inaccuracy of our statement,
if inaccurate it be. Let them produce any passage
from the Hebrew Bible in which the words <span class="rtl">ערב</span> (<i>Ghereb</i>)
and <span class="rtl">בקר</span> (<i>Boker</i>) are employed to designate the whole night
and the whole day. If they fail to do so,&mdash;and as far as
we are aware, no such passage has yet been discovered,&mdash;then
surely we may fairly contend that the interpretation
which thus explains the words in the first chapter of Genesis
cannot be regarded as certain: nor can the argument
founded on that interpretation be received as conclusive.</p>

<p>There is a text in the eighth chapter of the prophet
Daniel which might, perhaps, appear at first sight to militate
against our opinion. The prophet had a vision in
which it was foreshadowed that Antiochus Epiphanes should
come and prevail against the Jews, and should profane
the temple of God, and should abolish the daily sacrifice.
One of the Angels in the vision is heard asking of another,
for how long should the daily sacrifice cease, and the sanctuary
remain desolate. And the answer is given in these
words: “Unto <i>evening-morning</i> (<span class="rtl">עד ערב בקר</span>, <i>ghad ghereb
boker</i>) two thousand three hundred; then shall the
sanctuary be cleansed.”<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> Now, this is commonly understood
to mean that the daily sacrifice should be abolished
for two thousand three hundred <i>days</i>. And therefore, it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
would seem that, in this passage, the <i>evening and morning</i>
are used to signify the <i>whole civil day</i> of twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>We will not dispute the correctness of the interpretation
which is here set forth, although the words of the Angel
are explained in a very different sense by many eminent
commentators. But we think that the passage, even when
understood according to this interpretation, cannot fairly be
brought in evidence against us. The evening and the
morning do not make up the whole day: but they occur
once, and only once, in each day. Therefore a period
of many days may be properly signified by noting the
recurrence of the evening and morning a certain number
of times. And in point of fact, a usage of this kind
seems to prevail in most languages. The common word
<i>fortnight</i>, in English, affords a good illustration. It signifies
a period of fourteen nights and days: yet it does not
specify the recurrence of fourteen days, but only the recurrence
of fourteen nights. Again, the poet says:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Fair was she to behold, that maiden of seventeen <i>summers</i>.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Nobody would argue from these examples that the word
<i>summer</i> means a period of twelve months; or that the
word <i>night</i> means a period of twenty-four hours. And so,
in the case before us, the recurrence of the evening and
morning two thousand three hundred times may be pointed
out to mark a period of two thousand three hundred days,
although the evening and morning are not the whole day,
but only certain parts of the day. Nay, more; we fancy
we can see a good reason why the Angel in the vision
should single out the evening and the morning for special
notice. He had been asked about the profanation of the
sanctuary, and the abolition of the daily sacrifice. Now it
was in the evening and the morning that the daily sacrifice was
wont to be offered. And the Angel seems to answer: The
evening and the morning shall return two thousand three
hundred times; and there shall be no evening and morning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
sacrifice: but, after that time, the sanctuary shall be
cleansed and sacrifice restored.</p>

<p>So far we have been arguing from the common usage of
Scripture that the evening and the morning mentioned in
the history of the Creation cannot mean the whole night
and the whole day. But there is a special objection against
this interpretation from the history of the Creation itself.
The fifth verse in the first chapter of Genesis runs thus:
“And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called
Night. And there was evening and there was morning the
First Day.” In the first sentence it is recorded that God,
having divided the light from the darkness, gave to each its
proper name: He called the light, Day; and the darkness,
Night. Is it not highly improbable that, after this announcement,
the sacred writer would himself, in the very next sentence,
employ names altogether different, if he wished to
designate the period of light and the period of darkness?</p>

<p>We are not maintaining that the phrase under consideration&mdash;“there
was evening and there was morning the First
Day”&mdash;cannot be explained on the hypothesis that the Days
of Creation were days of twenty-four hours. But we do
contend that it affords no conclusive proof in favor of that
hypothesis; because even in that hypothesis the meaning of
the phrase is still doubtful and obscure. For ourselves, we
candidly confess we can offer no explanation that seems to
us, in any system of interpretation, altogether satisfactory.
We may be allowed, however, to call attention to an opinion
put forward by Saint Augustine, which fits in very appropriately
with the doctrine that the Days of Creation were
long periods of time. The distinctions of evening and
morning, he says, are not to be understood in reference to
the rising and setting of the Sun, which, in point of fact,
was not created until the Fourth Day; but rather in reference
to the works themselves that are recorded to have been
produced. In this way the evening will naturally represent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
the bringing to an end of the work that had been
accomplished; and the morning, on the other hand, the
coming in of the work that was to be. This opinion was
afterward adopted by Saint Eucherius, Bishop of Lyons,
who seems almost to borrow the very words of Saint
Augustine; and also by Venerable Bede, who says:
“What is the evening, but the completion of each work?
and the morning, but the beginning of the next?” In the
twelfth century we find it again set forth by Saint Hildegarde,
who was considered by Saint Bernard, as well as by
Pope Eugenius the Third, to have been gifted with the
spirit of prophecy.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> This interpretation, it is true, does
not explain the words <i>evening</i> and <i>morning</i> according to
their literal signification: but then the metaphorical sense
it ascribes to them is both simple and appropriate; more
especially if we understand the word Day in the sense of a
long and indefinite period. As the morning literally means
the break of day, and the evening its decline, the Sacred
Writer might, not inaptly, have employed these words to
represent metaphorically the opening and the close of the
various works which are ascribed to each successive period
in the history of the Creation.</p>

<p>It may be observed, moreover, that this explanation
seems quite in accord with the etymology of the Hebrew
words <span class="rtl">ע&#x5b6;ר&#x5b6;ב</span> (<i>Ghereb</i>), and <span class="rtl">בּקר</span> (<i>Boker</i>). The latter is formed
from the root <span class="rtl">בּק&#x5b6;ר</span> (<i>Bakar</i>), <i>to lay open</i>, and used to signify
the morning, because in the morning the light of the sun is,
as it were, unveiled, and <i>laid open</i> to the earth. Hence, the
word might be applied with much propriety, in a metaphorical
sense, to the unfolding of the various works of God, as
each new period was, in its turn, ushered in with a new act
of Creation. On the other hand, <span class="rtl">ע&#x5b6;ר&#x5b6;ב</span> (<i>Ghereb</i>) seems to be
derived from <span class="rtl">ערב</span> (<i>Gharab</i>), <i>to mingle</i>, and has probably
come to signify the evening, as the famous Hebrew scholar,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
Aben Ezra, suggests, because, in the uncertain light of evening,
the forms of external objects lose their distinctness of
outline, and become, in a manner, blended together. And
so this word might have been employed, not unfitly, to represent
the close of each period in the creation, which was
marked, as Geologists tell us, by the gradual dying out or
extinction of the various forms of life peculiar to that period.
Anyhow, in following the opinion of so ancient and so venerable
an authority as Saint Augustine, we cannot be charged
with unduly straining the Sacred Text to meet the exigencies
of modern science.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next argument is founded on a passage in Exodus, to
which we have already had occasion to refer: “Six days
shalt thou labor, and do all thy work. But the seventh day
is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: thou shalt do no work
on it, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant,
nor thy maid-servant, nor thy beast, nor the stranger
that is within thy gates. For in six days the Lord made
the Heavens and the Earth, and the sea, and all that in
them is, and rested the seventh day; therefore the Lord
blessed the seventh day and sanctified it.”<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> We are to work
upon six days, and to rest upon the seventh; <i>because</i> in six
days God accomplished all the works of the creation, and
rested on the seventh. There can be no mistake as to the
meaning of this commandment. The six days on which it is
lawful to labor are, beyond all doubt, six days in the common
sense of the word; six days of twenty-four hours each:
and the seventh day, on which it is forbidden to work, is a
day of the same kind. But the example of God’s labor and
God’s rest is set forth, in the text, as the pattern after which
this law of the Sabbath was framed. And therefore, the
six days in which God furnished and embellished the
earth must have been likewise six days of twenty-four
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
hours each. This argument is regarded by many writers
as decisive.</p>

<p>To us, on the contrary, it seems by no means necessary
to understand the days on which God labored and rested,
in precisely the same sense as the days on which it is enjoined
that we should labor and rest. The examples of
God is, no doubt, represented in the Sacred Text as the
reason for the Jewish Sabbath: “Six days shalt thou labor,
and rest upon the seventh; <i>for</i> in six days the Lord made
the Heavens and the Earth, and rested on the seventh.”
But, suppose for a moment that the days of creation were
long periods of time, will not the significance of this reason
remain unchanged? As God, in the great work of the
creation, labored for six successive periods, and then rested
for a seventh, so shall you likewise do all your work during
six of those successive periods into which your time is divided,
and rest upon the seventh.</p>

<p>In support of this view, we may observe that the Jews were
commanded to abstain from work, not only every seventh
<i>day</i>, but also every seventh <i>year</i>. “Six years thou shalt
sow thy ground, and shalt gather the corn thereof; but the
seventh year thou shalt let it alone, and suffer it to rest, that
the poor of thy people may eat, and whatsoever shall be left,
let the beasts of the field eat it: in like manner shalt thou
do with thy vineyard and thy oliveyard. Six days shalt thou
work: the seventh day thou shalt cease, that thy ox and
thy ass may rest; and the son of thy handmaid and the
stranger may be refreshed.”<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> And in another place we read:
“When you shall have entered into the land which I will
give you, observe the rest of the Sabbath to the Lord. Six
years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune
thy vineyard, and shalt gather the fruits thereof; but in the
seventh year there shall be a Sabbath to the land, of the resting
of the Lord; thou shalt not sow thy field, nor prune
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
thy vineyard. What the ground shall bring forth of itself
thou shalt not reap: neither shalt thou gather the grapes of
the first fruits as a vintage; for it is a year of rest to the land:
But they shall be unto you for meat; to thee, and to thy
man-servant, and to thy maid-servant, and to thy hireling,
and to the strangers that sojourn with thee, to thy beasts of
burden, and to thy cattle, all things that grow shall be for
meat.”<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> The seventh year, then, according to Divine command,
was a year of rest among the Jews, just as the seventh
day was a day of rest; and it is evident that the one precept,
no less than the other, was founded on the great example of
God’s rest when He had finished the work of Creation. We
are satisfied, therefore, that whatever may have been the
length of those six days in which God labored, and of the
seventh day on which He rested, His example might still be
properly set forth as the model on which the law of the Sabbath
was founded.</p>

<p>It is urged, however, that in this passage of Exodus, we
have the same word <span class="rtl">יוֺם</span> (<i>yom</i>) applied in the very same
context to the six days of the Creation and to the six days
of the week; and it can hardly be supposed that the
inspired writer would pass thus suddenly from one meaning
of the word to another, and a very different meaning,
without giving any intimation to his readers of such a transition.
If this argument is a good one, we can only say
that it completely oversets the opinion of those against
whom we are contending. In the fifth verse of the first
chapter of Genesis we read: “And God called the <i>light</i>
<i>Day</i>, and the <i>darkness</i> he called <i>Night</i>. And there was
evening and there was morning the first <i>Day</i>.” Now, those
who reject the theory of long periods, maintain that by the
word Day in the latter part of this verse, is meant the
whole civil day of twenty-four hours; while it is plain that,
in the earlier part of the verse, the same word Day is emphatically
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
applied to only a part of that period&mdash;that is, to
the time of light as distinguished from the time of darkness.
Therefore, they are themselves, in fact, upholding an interpretation
which supposes the inspired writer to pass from
one meaning of the word Day to another, without any intimation
of a change of meaning.</p>

<p>But we do not want to shrink from dealing with this
argument on its merits. The principle on which it is
founded seems to us unsound and inconsistent with the
evidence of the Sacred Books themselves. It is quite a
common thing, we contend, in Scripture, for the writer to
pass from one meaning of a word to another without any
explicit indication of such a transition, when, as in the case
before us, the two senses, though different, are analogous:
the one being, as it were, the figure, or the symbol, or the
pattern, of the other. A few examples will make this clear.
In the Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians, we
read as follows: “For the charity of Christ presseth us:
judging this, that if one <i>died</i> for all, then all were <i>dead</i>;
and Christ <i>died</i> for all.”<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> Here, when it is said that “all
were <i>dead</i>,” the meaning is, that all men were <i>dead spiritually</i>
by sin; whereas, in the clause immediately preceding, and in
the clause immediately following, the same word is used in
its literal sense for the death of Christ upon the cross.
And yet the Apostle, though he thus passed from the literal
to the metaphorical sense of the word, and then back again
from the metaphorical sense to the literal, gives no express
indication of these transitions.</p>

<p>Again, in the Gospel, when a certain man, being called
by our Lord, said: “Lord, suffer me first to go and bury
my father,” Jesus reproved him in these words: “Let
the <i>dead</i> bury their <i>dead</i>; but go thou and preach the
kingdom of God.”<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> There is some difference of opinion
amongst commentators as to the exact meaning of this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
phrase. But whatever interpretation be adopted, it seems
evident from the context that the <i>dead to be buried</i> were those
who were literally dead; whereas, the <i>dead</i> who were to
<i>bury them</i> were manifestly <i>not</i> those who were literally dead,
but those who were dead in some analogous or metaphorical
sense. Another example occurs in the twentieth chapter
of Saint John. Christ says to His Apostles: “I ascend
to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.”<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a>
When He says, “I ascend to my Father,” the meaning is,
“to Him who has begotten me from all eternity.” When
He adds, “and your Father,” the meaning is, “to Him who
has <i>adopted</i> you for His children.” Here, then, the word
Father is first used in the sense of a natural father, and
immediately after in the sense of a father by adoption, without
any explicit declaration of a change in meaning.</p>

<p>The Epistle of Saint Paul to the Romans furnishes an
instance in which the transition from one meaning to
another occurs in the case of the word Day itself: “The
night is passed, and the <i>day</i> is at hand. Let us, therefore,
cast off the works of darkness, and put on the armor of
light. Let us walk honestly as in the <i>day</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> The word
Day, in the earlier part of this passage, is used by Saint
Paul for the Day of Eternity which is to follow the darkness
of this life; while, in the next sentence, it means
clearly the period of light between sunrise and sunset.
Another illustration of the same kind occurs in the first
Epistle to the Thessalonians. “But you, brethren, are
not in darkness that that <i>day</i> should overtake you as a thief;
for you are all the children of light and the children of the
<i>day</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> No one familiar with the language of Scripture
can doubt that the first <i>day</i> here is the Day of Judgment;
and it is quite plain that the second <i>day</i> is <i>not</i> the Day of
Judgment.</p>

<p>Our next example, and one most appropriate to our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
purpose, is taken from the prophet Amos: “And it shall
come to pass in that <i>day</i>, saith the Lord God, that I will
make the sun go down at noon, and I will darken the
earth in the clear <i>day</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> This prophecy is commonly
referred by the Fathers to the time of our Lord, when the
earth was darkened in the clear day on the occasion of
His crucifixion; but some eminent authorities, with Saint
Jerome at their head, explain it of the Captivity in Babylon.
Either interpretation will suit our argument. The sacred
writer first employs the word Day for a long period of time,
and afterward proceeds to use it in its more ordinary sense,
without giving his readers any express intimation of such a
transition.</p>

<p>We hope it is now pretty clear that neither the reason
assigned for the institution of the Sabbath Day, nor the
particular form of words in which that ordinance is set forth,
offers any insurmountable obstacle to the opinion we are
defending. And this is quite enough for our purpose.
For we would again remind our readers that we are not
attempting to prove from the Sacred Text that this opinion
<i>must</i> be true, but only that it <i>may</i> be true. Our object
has been sufficiently attained if we have succeeded in showing
that the hypothesis which makes the Days of Creation
long periods, is not inconsistent with the language of
Scripture.</p>

<p>We are tempted, however, in the case of this objection,
to go somewhat further than the scope of our argument
strictly demands. The text we have just been discussing
brings before us, in fact, a consideration of great weight in
favor of the system of long periods. “In six days the Lord
made the Heavens and the Earth and the sea, and all that
in them is, and rested on the seventh day.” Now, what was
this Seventh Day on which God rested? Was it a common
day of twenty-four hours? or was it not rather a long and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
undefined period of time? Saint Augustine answers plainly
enough: “The seventh day,” he says, “is without an
evening, and has no setting.” And Venerable Bede, asking
why the sacred writer had assigned no evening to the
seventh day, gives this answer: “Because it has no end,
and is shut in by no limit.”<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></p>

<p>The common sentiment of Theologians, as far as we
know, seems to point in the same direction. They tell us
that God is said to have rested, inasmuch as He ceased
from the creation of new species; and they hold that since
the close of the Sixth Day no new species have been
brought into existence. But whether this be true or not,
it would be very difficult, we think, to point out any sense
in which God can be said to have rested after the work of
the Six Days, and in which He is not resting at the present
moment. If so, the day of His rest is still going on; and
it is not a period of twenty-four hours only, but a period
of many thousand years. Now, if the Seventh Day on
which God rested is a period of many thousand years, are
we not fully justified in supposing that the Six Days on
which He formed and furnished the Heavens and the Earth
were likewise periods of many ages?</p>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/t.jpg" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span> results at which we have arrived by the long,
and we fear tedious, line of argument pursued in
the last Chapter, may be briefly summed up. First,
many illustrious Fathers of the Church&mdash;Saint Augustine,
Origen, Clement of Alexandria, Saint Athanasius, and
others&mdash;plainly declared against the opinion that the Days
of Creation were days in the ordinary sense of the word;
and, therefore, it is a mistake to suppose that this opinion
is supported by the unanimous voice of Christian tradition.
Secondly, the word Day is frequently used in Scripture for a
long period of time, and sometimes for a period of indefinite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
duration. Thirdly, there is nothing in the language of
Moses that forbids us to explain the word according to this
sense, in the first chapter of Genesis. And fourthly, there
is, at least, one grave consideration, derived from Holy
Scripture itself, which distinctly points to such an interpretation.
The Six Days of Creation are contrasted with the
Seventh Day of God’s rest; and this Seventh Day of God’s
rest is unquestionably a long period of undefined duration.
From all this it is obvious to conclude, that we may fairly
adopt this mode of interpreting the Mosaic Days, if it will
assist us in reconciling the received conclusions of science
with the truths of Revelation.</p>

<p>Now, there is a striking resemblance, in some important
respects, between the order of Creation as exhibited in the successive
days of the Sacred Record, and the order of Creation
as manifested in the successive periods of Geological time.
Three days are specially marked out by the Inspired Historian
as distinguished by the creation of vegetable and
animal life&mdash;the Third, the Fifth, and the Sixth. On the
Third Day were created plants and trees; on the Fifth, reptiles,
fish, and birds; on the Sixth, cattle, and the beasts of
the earth, and, toward the end, man himself. Geologists,
on the other hand, not influenced in the least degree by the
Scripture narrative, but guided chiefly by the remains of
animal and vegetable life which are preserved in the Crust
of the Earth, have established three leading divisions of
Geological time; the Pal&aelig;ozoic, or first age of organic life,
the Mesozoic, or second great age of organic life, and the
Kainozoic, or third great age of organic life. Here, no
doubt, is a remarkable coincidence.</p>

<p>But it would be still more remarkable if we could recognize,
in the three epochs of Geology, the same general
characteristics of organic life as we find ascribed by Moses
to the three successive days of the Bible narrative. And so
we may, it is said, if we will only take the pains to examine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
for ourselves the organic remains of these geological epochs
as they lie dispersed through the Crust of the Earth, or even
as they are to be found collected and arranged for exhibition
in our museums. The first great age of Geology is eminently
distinguished for its plants and trees; the second, for
its huge reptiles and great sea-monsters; the third, for its
vast herds of noble quadrupeds. Nay, to complete the harmony
between the two Records, as man is represented by
the Inspired Writer to have been created toward the close
of the last day, so, toward the close of the last Geological
age, the remains of man and of his works are found, for the
first time, laid by in the archives of the Earth.</p>

<p>Such is the coincidence which some ingenious writers
fancy they can trace between the history that is set forth in
the written Word of God, and the history that is so curiously
inscribed upon His works. Our readers, perhaps, will not
be unwilling to consider it a little more in detail. We read
in the first chapter of Genesis, that on the Third Day God
said: “Let the earth bring forth the green herb, and such
as may seed, and the fruit-tree yielding fruit after its kind,
which may have seed in itself upon the earth. And it was
so done. And the earth brought forth the green herb, and
such as yieldeth seed according to its kind, and the tree that
beareth fruit, having seed each one according to its kind.
And God saw that it was good.”<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> Let us now turn to the
Carboniferous Period of Geology, which occupies a large
space in the great Pal&aelig;ozoic age. All writers agree that it
was specially marked by a gorgeous and luxuriant vegetation:
and as we contemplate the multitudinous remains
of plants and trees which have been gathered so abundantly
in our coal measures, and ranged with such striking effect
along the walls of our museums, we can scarcely help thinking
that we have before us a practical commentary on the
text of Moses. The gifted Hugh Miller, who is universally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
allowed to have been one of the most practical and experienced
Geologists of the modern school, gives a very picturesque
and graphic sketch of the Carboniferous flora. “In
no other age,” he says, “did the world ever witness such a
flora: the youth of the earth was peculiarly a green and
umbrageous youth,&mdash;a youth of dusk and tangled forests,&mdash;of
huge pines and stately araucarians,&mdash;of the reed-like
calamite, the tall tree-fern, the sculptured sigillaria, and the
hirsute lepidodendron. Wherever dry land, or shallow lake
or running stream appeared, from where Melville Island
now spreads out its ice-wastes under the star of the pole, to
where the arid plains of Australia lie solitary beneath the
bright cross of the south, a rank and luxuriant herbage cumbered
every footbreadth of the dank and steaming soil; and
even to distant planets our earth must have shown, through the
enveloping cloud, with a green and delicate ray.”<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> Such an
age as this might well be described in history as the age in
which the earth brought forth the green herb, and the fruit-tree
yielding seed according to its kind.</p>

<p>Again, the work of the Fifth Day is thus described in the
Sacred Narrative:&mdash;“God also said: Let the waters bring
forth the creeping creature having life, and the fowl that may
fly over the earth under the firmament of Heaven. And
God created the great whales, and every living and moving
creature which the waters brought forth, according to their
kinds, and every winged fowl according to its kind. And
God saw that it was good.”<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> And in this case, as in the
former, we may find the counterpart of the Bible story in
the records of Geology. “The secondary age of the geologist,”
says the eminent writer from whom we have already
quoted, “possessed, like the earlier one, its herbs and plants,
but they were of a greatly less luxuriant and conspicuous
character than their predecessors, and no longer formed the
prominent trait or feature of the creation to which they belong.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
The period had also its corals, its crustaceans, its
molluscs, its fishes, and, in some one or two exceptional
instances, its dwarf mammals. But the grand existences of
the age,&mdash;the existences in which it excelled every other
creation, earlier or later,&mdash;were its huge creeping things,&mdash;its
enormous monsters of the deep,&mdash;and, as shown by the
impressions of their footprints stamped upon the rocks, its
gigantic birds. It was peculiarly the age of egg-bearing
animals, winged and wingless. Its wonderful <i>whales</i>, not
however as now, of the mammalian, but of the reptilian class&mdash;ichthyosaurs,
plesiosaurs, and cetiosaurs&mdash;must have tempested
the deep; its creeping lizards and crocodiles, such
as the teleosaurus megalosaurus, and iguanodon,&mdash;creatures
some of which more than rival the existing elephant
in height, and greatly more than rivalled him in bulk,&mdash;must
have crowded the plains, or haunted by myriads the
rivers of the period; and we know that the foot-prints of,
at least, one of its many birds, are fully twice the size of
those made by the horse or camel. We are thus prepared
to demonstrate that the second period of the geologist was
peculiarly and characteristically a period of whale-like
reptiles of the sea, of enormous creeping reptiles of the
land, and of numerous birds, some of them of gigantic
size.”<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></p>

<p>Once more, it is written that, on the Sixth Day, “God
said: Let the earth bring forth the living creature in its kind,
cattle and creeping things, and beasts of the earth, according
to their kinds. And it was so done. And God made the
beasts of the earth according to their kinds, and cattle and
every thing that creepeth on the earth after its kind. And
God saw that it was good.”<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> And again Geology seems to
confirm the truth of the Inspired narrative, and to fill up the
details of the picture. “The Tertiary period,” continues
Hugh Miller, “had also its prominent class of existences.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
Its flora seems to have been no more conspicuous than that
of the present time; its reptiles occupy a very subordinate
place; but its beasts of the field were by far the most wonderfully
developed, both in size and numbers, that ever
appeared upon the earth. Its mammoths and its mastodons,
its rhinoceri and its hippopotami, its enormous dimotherium
and colossal megatherium, greatly more than equalled in
bulk the greatest mammals of the present time, and vastly
exceeded them in number. The remains of one of its
elephants (Elephas primigenius) are still so abundant amid
the frozen wastes of Siberia, that what have been not inappropriately
termed ‘ivory quarries’ have been wrought
among their bones for more than a hundred years. Even
in our own country, of which, as I have already shown, this
elephant was for long ages a native, so abundant are the
skeletons and tusks, that there is scarcely a local museum
in the kingdom that has not its specimens, dug out of the
Pleistocene deposits of the neighborhood. And with this
ancient elephant there were meetly associated in Britain, as
on the northern continents generally all around the globe,
many other mammals of corresponding magnitude. ‘Grand
indeed,’ says an English naturalist, ‘was the fauna of the
British islands in those early days. Tigers as large again as
the biggest Asiatic species lurked in the ancient thickets;
elephants nearly twice the size of the largest individuals that
now exist in Africa or Ceylon roamed in herds: at least two
species of the rhinoceros forced their way through the primeval
forests; and the lakes and rivers were tenanted by
hippopotami as bulky, and with as great tusks, as those of
Africa.’ The massive cave-bear and large cave-hy&aelig;na belong
to the same formidable group, with at least two species
of great oxen, with a horse of smaller size, and an elk
that stood ten feet four inches in height. Truly this Tertiary
age&mdash;this third and last of the geologic periods&mdash;was peculiarly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
the age of great ‘beasts of the earth after their kind,
and of cattle after their kind.’”<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></p>

<p>We shall be told, perhaps, that there are Six Days assigned
to the work of creation in the Mosaic narrative, and that we
have accounted but for three. Let it be remembered, however,
that Geology does not profess to give a complete history
of our Globe. It can set before us those events only
which have left their impress indelibly stamped upon the
rocks that compose the Crust of the Earth. These events
Geologists have attempted to reduce to the order of a chronological
system; and in prosecuting this task they have been
guided almost exclusively by the evidence of Organic Remains.
Hence it was not to be expected that, in Geological
Chronology, we should find a Period specially set apart
as the Period in which Light was made; or another as the
Period in which the Firmament was spread out over the Earth;
or a Third as the Period in which the sun and moon and
stars shone forth in the expanse of Heaven. Such phenomena
had, indeed, a very important influence on the physical
condition of our globe. But they must occupy a very
secondary place, if indeed they are distinctly chronicled at
all in the records of Geology. It is the formation of rocks
and the embedding therein of Fossil Remains that constitute
the main study of the Geologist, and that guide him in the
distribution of Geological time.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we would observe that the scheme of Chronology
which Geologists put before us, affords abundant
room for each and all of the Mosaic Days. Let it be
assumed for a moment that the Carboniferous Period corresponds
with the Third Day of the Sacred narrative. The
earlier Periods of the Pal&aelig;ozoic Age will then fit in with
the First and Second Days of Scripture; and the Permian,
which intervenes between the Carboniferous Period and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
Secondary Age, may be supposed to correspond with the
Fourth Day of Scripture. This adjustment between the
Mosaic Days and the Periods of Geology will probably be
made more intelligible to the general reader by the Table
that appears on the following page.</p>

<p>The reader must not think it amiss, in this distribution
of the Mosaic Days, that four out of six are crowded
together into one Geological Age, while each of the other
two has an entire Age assigned to itself. If the Days of
Creation were indefinite periods, there is no incongruity in
supposing that one may have corresponded to a longer,
another to a shorter interval in the history of our planet.
But, in truth, our scheme of distribution does not of necessity
imply that the Mosaic Days were periods of unequal
length. Geologists do not pretend that there is even a
remote approximation to equality between the several divisions
of Geological time. The three great Epochs are distinguished
from each other by reason of the very marked
difference in the character of their Fossil Remains. And
the multiplication of Periods in each Epoch seems to depend
rather upon the degree of completeness with which
the strata of that Age have been examined, than upon any
conjecture as to the probable length of its duration. Thus,
for example, Sir Charles Lyell thinks that, as far as the
present condition of Science affords the means of forming
an opinion, almost any one of the Periods in the Pal&aelig;ozoic
Age was as long as all the Periods of the Tertiary Age
taken together.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a></p>

<p>But there is another and a more serious objection against
our hypothesis. It has been observed more than once that
the periods of Geology are out of harmony with the Days
of Genesis, even as regards the history of Organic life.
According to the Scripture narrative no Organic life appeared
upon the Earth previous to the Third Day. Now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
the Third Day of Scripture corresponds, in our scheme,
with the Carboniferous Period of Geology. And yet there
is abundant evidence in the Fossil Remains of the Devonian,
the Silurian, and the Cambrian Formations, that
Organic life&mdash;both plants and animals&mdash;prevailed upon
the Earth for many ages before the Carboniferous Period
began. Nay, it is now commonly held, since the discovery
of the famous <i>Eozoon Canadense</i>, the oldest known Fossil,
that life already existed during the deposition of the Laurentian
Rocks, the earliest of all the Stratified Formations.
Furthermore, in the Mosaic account, Fish are represented
as having been created only on the Fifth Day, which we have
fitted in with the Secondary Age of Geology: whereas in the
Geological Record we find Fish as early as the Silurian
Period, which is far back in the Primary Age. These considerations,
and divers others of a like nature, have been
regarded by some eminent writers as altogether fatal to
the hypothesis for which we are contending.</p>

<p>To us, however, it appears that such points of discrepancy
involve no contradiction between the two Records.
The Sacred Writer tells us, no doubt, that on the Third
Day God created plants and trees: but he does not say,
either expressly or otherwise, that previous to the Third
Day the Earth was devoid of vegetation. Again, we read
that reptiles, fish, and birds were created on the Fifth Day.
But there is nothing in the language of the Inspired narrative
from which it can be inferred that these several classes
of animal life may not have been represented before that
time, by many and various species: though probably, it
was only on the Fifth Day that they were developed in such
vast numbers, and assumed such gigantic proportions, as
to become the most conspicuous objects of creation.</p>

<p>The first chapter of Genesis is but a brief summary of
an inconceivably vast series of events. It is nothing more
than a rapid sketch, exhibiting, as it were, to the eye the
prominent features in the history of Creation. Moreover,
we should remember that it was written with a specific end
in view. The purpose of the Sacred Writer was plainly to
impress upon the Hebrew people, naturally prone to idolatry,
the existence of One Supreme Being, who has made all
things. Hence we should naturally expect that, amid the
boundless variety of God’s works, he would make choice
of those that were most calculated to strike the mind with
wonder and awe, and to bring home to a rude and uncultivated
race of men the Almighty Power and Supreme Dominion
of the Great Creator. Now the Zoophytes, and
Graptolites, and Trilobites, of the Devonian and Silurian
Periods, however curious and interesting they may be to
men of science, would have had but little significance for the
Jewish people. Let us suppose that these more humble
forms of animal life had, in fact, existed during the First
and Second Days of the Mosaic narrative, and where is the
wonder that the Inspired Historian, under the guidance of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
the Holy Spirit, should pass them by in silence, and choose
rather to commemorate the more striking and impressive
facts, that, at the bidding of God, Light shone forth from
the midst of darkness, and the blue firmament of Heaven
was expanded above the waste of waters?</p>

<p>We say, then, that events which are simply left unrecorded
by the Sacred Writer are not, on that account,
untrue:<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> that he describes to us, not all the works of
Creation, which would have been an endless task, but only
the more conspicuous objects in each successive stage; and
that he sketches them, most probably, as they would have
appeared to the eye of a human observer, if a human
observer at the time had existed on the Earth. If this view
be admitted, then it is not inconsistent with the Scripture
narrative to suppose that plants may have existed before
the Third Day, and fish before the Fifth. Each Day in its
turn would have been rendered conspicuous to an observing
spectator by those events which are recorded by Moses.
But each Day, too, would have witnessed many other events,
unnoticed by Moses, of which the memorials have been
preserved, even to our time, in the Crust of the Earth.</p>

<p>We should observe, however, that though this scheme of
adapting the Periods of Geology to the Days of Moses, may
be defended as a legitimate hypothesis, it cannot be upheld
as an established truth. The geological records that have
hitherto been brought to light represent but the merest
fragment of the Earth’s past history. Each year that passes
over our heads is adding largely to the store of facts already
accumulated. And it needs but little reflection to perceive
that an hypothesis may be quite consistent with the knowledge
we possess to-day, and yet may be found altogether
inconsistent with the knowledge we shall possess to-morrow.
We must be content, therefore, to suspend our judgment,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
and to await the progress of events. It may be that future
discoveries shall bring to light new points of harmony
between the Days of Genesis and the Periods of Geology;
it may be they shall demonstrate that no such harmony
exists. For us it is enough to have shown that this hypothesis
is consistent, on the one hand, with the story of
Genesis&mdash;on the other, with the actual discoveries of Geology;
and, therefore, that it may be adopted, in the present
condition of our knowledge, as a legitimate means of
reconciling the established conclusions of that science with
the truths of Revelation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span>&mdash;We have, then, two distinct systems of interpretation,
according to which the vast Antiquity of the
Earth, asserted by Geology, may be fairly brought into harmony
with the history of creation, recorded in Scripture.
The one allows an interval of incalculable duration between
the creation of the Heavens and the Earth, and the work of
the Six Days: the other supposes each one of these Six
Days to have been itself an indefinite period of time. We
cannot, indeed, prove that either of these two systems is true
in point of fact; but we have attempted to show that neither is
at variance with the language of the Sacred Text. On the other
hand, when we look to the evidence of geological facts, we
see no decisive reason for preferring one to the other. Either
mode of interpretation seems in itself quite sufficient to
meet all the present requirements of Geology; for, according
to either interpretation, the Bible narrative would allow
time without limit for the past history of our Globe; and
time without limit is just what Geology demands. We may
say, then, on this point, what Saint Augustine said long ago,
in speaking of the diverse interpretations which the text of
Genesis admits: “Let each one choose according to the best
of his power: only let him not rashly put forward as known
that which is unknown; and let him not fail to remember
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
that he is but a man searching, as far as may be, into the
works of God.”<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></p>

<p>It must not be supposed that, according to our view, the
Sacred Writer, in composing his account of the Creation,
had before his mind those vast Geological Periods about
which we have said so much in the course of this volume.
Such an opinion is no part of our system. We see no good
reason for believing that the author of Genesis was specially
enlightened from Heaven on the subject of Stratified Rocks
and Fossil Remains, of Upheaval and Denudation, of Volcanic
Action and Subterranean Heat. These are matters of
Physical, not of Religious Science. And it seems to be the
order of Providence to leave the discovery of such things to
the industry and ingenuity of man: “Cuncta fecit bona in
tempore suo, et mundum tradidit disputationi eorum.”<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></p>

<p>What we maintain, then, is simply this: that the Sacred
Writer recorded faithfully, in language fitted to the ideas of
his time, that portion of Revelation which was committed to
him; and, in the accomplishment of this task, made such
a choice of words and phrases, under the guidance of the
Holy Spirit, to whom all truth is present, as to set forth
plainly those facts that were unfolded to him, without introducing
any error about those facts of which he was ignorant.
The language is the language of men, but the voice
that speaks therein is the voice of God. And thus it comes
to pass that this Mosaic story, when fairly examined according
to the ordinary laws of human speech, is found in every
age to accommodate itself, with quite an unexpected simplicity,
to those new and wonderful views of God’s manifold
power which each human science in its turn brings to
light.</p>

<p>Before taking leave of the subject, we would venture to
bring under the notice of our readers one very obvious reflection,
which is sometimes lost sight of in the heat of controversy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
The Mosaic history of the Creation absolutely
stands alone. It has no rivals, no competitors. Every other
attempt that has been made to explain the origin of the
world, and of the human race, is refuted by its own intrinsic
extravagance and absurdity. The wisest nations of antiquity
failed to discover that great fundamental truth, which stands
out so boldly on the first page of Genesis, that there is One
God who hath made all things. The philosophers of Chald&aelig;a
were familiar with the course of the Heavens, and
could predict the eclipses of the sun and moon. But the
philosophers of Chald&aelig;a could not rise from the contemplation
of creatures to the knowledge of the Creator: the creatures
themselves were the gods that Chald&aelig;a worshipped.
Egypt had greatness of mind to conceive the idea of the
Pyramids, and skill to devise the plan of their construction,
and strength of arms to lift up the huge stones on these
stupendous piles. But Egypt raised up temples to the river
that waters its plain, and offered sacrifice to the reptile
that crawls upon the earth, and the beast that grazes in the
field. In Greece the human mind soared to its highest
flight, and ranged over the widest and most beautiful fields
of thought. Peerless is she among the nations, the mistress
of the arts, the fountain source of refined taste, the storehouse
of intellectual power, the great nurse of human genius.
Her schools of philosophy have influenced and guided to a
marvellous extent the thoughts and speculations of all subsequent
times. The song of her immortal bard has kindled
the imagination of the poet in every generation, and
enriched his mind with glowing images. Orators and statesmen
still love to copy the lofty sentiments, the graceful
diction, the flowing periods, of her golden eloquence. And
students from every clime stand enraptured before the beauty
and the majesty of her sculptured marble. But Greece,
Imperial Greece, knew not the One God, the giver of all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
good gifts, by whom she was so highly endowed. She fashioned
for herself gods and goddesses after her own fancy,
and portioned out the universe between them. Jupiter
hurled his thunderbolts from the clouds: Neptune ruled the
sea: Pluto swayed the sceptre of the infernal regions: Minerva
was the goddess of wisdom: Vulcan the god of fire:
Apollo the god of music. Nay, the very infirmities and
vices of human nature were personified under the names of
divinities, and worshipped in the Pantheon of the gods.
Rome, too, the conqueror of the world, had its philosophers
and its orators, its poets and its sculptors, whose productions
still charm and instruct mankind. Yet was Rome
no exception to the common lot of the gentile world. For
Rome, like Greece, had its long array of gods and goddesses,
with their petty jealousies, their vindictive malice,
their shameless passions. Alone, amidst all the Mythologies
and Cosmogonies of ancient nations, the story of the
Hebrew Legislator rises superior to the gross and silly speculations
of mortal men. It alone proclaims to mankind
what Philosophy and Science, when left to themselves, have
never been able to teach, that, In the beginning God created
the Heavens and the Earth; that the plants and the animals,
the ocean and the elements, the sun and moon and stars,
man himself, and all that delights the eye and charms the
ear and fills the mind, are His creatures; and that besides
Him there is no other God. Away, then, with the idea that
this Sacred Narrative, stamped as it plainly is with the imprint
of its Divine Author, should ever be found at variance
with the truths of science,&mdash;or rather, we should say, with
those scanty fragments of truth, those crumbs of knowledge,
falling from the table of our Heavenly Father, which it is
given to man here below to gather up with laborious care,
and which, however they may excite his longings, cannot
satisfy his hunger.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span></p>

<p>Here, for the present, we must stop. At some future
time, perhaps, if our opportunities permit, we shall return
to this subject, and, taking up the second branch of the controversy,
investigate the recent discoveries of Geology in
reference to the teaching of the Bible as regards the Antiquity
of the Human Race.</p>

Migne, Patr. Graec. Cursus Completus, tom. 53, p. 33. Here
Saint Chrysostom plainly teaches that the world existed before
the creation of light. In his Fifth Homily he is equally clear
that the First Day of the Mosaic narrative began with a period
of light, and not with a period of darkness: “Vide quomodo de
singulis diebus sic dicat: <i>Et factum est vespere, et factum est
mane, dies tertius</i>: non simpliciter nec absque causa: sed ne
ordinem confundamus neque putemus vespera ingruente finem
accepisse diem; sed sciamus vesperam finem esse lucis, et
principium noctis: mane autem finem noctis, et complementum

This work is classed by Migne among the Dubia et Spuria of
Bede. The critics, however, seem to be agreed that it belongs
to a period not later than the tenth century. If it is not the
genuine composition of Bede, which is considered more probable,
then it only follows that we have, besides Bede, another
ancient authority in favor of our opinion.</p>

universitatem a Deo conditore profectam esse. Quare ita pronuntiavit,
tanquam diceret: Quidquid videtis et quodcumque

<p>“Imprimis <i>ante dierum sex initium</i> solam cum aqua terram
extitisse credimus:.... Habet haec opinio fidem ex Mosis
narratione; qui ante coelum id est <i>firmamentum</i>, terram, et
aquarum abyssum extitisse refert.... Nam illud Severiani
valde probatur, prima die Deum omnia creasse: reliquis autem
diebus, ex jam extantibus: Ubi primam diem non lucis
tantum creatione circumscribit: sed quod ante illam factum
est, id eidem tribuit. Quod intervallum quantum fuerit,
nulla divinatio posset assequi. Neque vero mundi corpora

<h3>(27.) <span class="smcap">Saint Eucherius.&mdash;p. 320.</span></h3>

<p>Speaking strictly we should rather say the author of a Commentary
upon Genesis belonging to a very early period of the
Church, ascribed by some to Saint Eucherius, and usually
published with his works. This author says, no doubt, that
God first, in the beginning, created the substance of all
things, and afterward developed the various forms on successive
days (Gen. ii. 4): but then he tells us expressly that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
substance did not precede the forms by any priority of time,
but only by priority of origin (Gen. i. 2). Thus his view
coincides pretty nearly with that of Saint Augustine, whose
words, indeed, he seems to borrow. “‘Terra autem erat
inanis et vacua.’ Id est, adhuc informis erat ipsa materia:
quia necdum ex ea coelum et terra, necdum omnia formata
erant, quae formari restabant: haec enim materia, ex nihilo
facta, praecessit tamen res ex se factas, <i>non quidem aeternitate
vel tempore, sicut praecedit lignum arcam</i>; sed sola origine,
<i>sicut praecedit vox verbum, vel sonus cantum</i>: nam ‘qui vivit
in aeternum creavit omnia simul.’”&mdash;Edit. Migne, Patr. Latin

opinion of Saint Augustine that there was no real succession
in the order of time between the various works of the creation,
but that all were created together; and also the opinion
of other Holy Fathers, that there was a real succession, he
continues thus: “Prima ergo opinio [Sancti Augustini] <i>magis
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>

quae in Scriptura ordinem temporis importare videntur, ad

<p>We are again indebted to Perrerius for the views of Cardinal
Cajetan. He writes thus: “Accedit huic sententi&aelig; Cajet.

naturalem rerum ordinem, consequentiam et dependentiam.

herbis consita; sed <i>more sibi solito Scriptura diem pro tempore
ponit</i>; quomodo Apostolus, cum ait, ‘Ecce nunc dies

moram et longitudinem temporis possent sentire homines

<h3>COSMOGONY.</h3>

<p>The science of cosmogony treats of the history of creation.</p>

<p>Geology comprises that later portion of the history which is
within the range of direct investigation, beginning with the
rock-covered globe, and gathering only a few hints as to
a previous state of igneous fluidity.</p>

<p>Through Astronomy our knowledge of this earlier state
becomes less doubtful, and we even discover evidence of a
period still more remote. Ascertaining thence that the sun
of our system is in intense ignition, that the moon, the earth’s
satellite, was once a globe of fire, but is now cooled and
covered with extinct craters, and that space is filled with
burning suns,&mdash;and learning also from physical science that
all heated bodies in space must have been losing heat through
past time, the smallest most rapidly,&mdash;we safely conclude that
the earth has passed through a stage of igneous fluidity.</p>

<p>Again, as to the remoter period: the forms of the nebul&aelig;
and of other starry systems in the heavens, and the relations
which subsist between the spheres in our own system, have
been found to be such as would have resulted if the whole
universe had been evolved from an original nebula or
gaseous fluid. It is not necessary for the strength of this
argument that any portion of the primal nebula should exist
now at this late period in the history of the universe: it is
only what might have been expected that the nebul&aelig; of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
present heavens should be turning out to be clusters of stars.
If, then, this nebular theory be true, the universe has been
developed from a primal unit, and the earth is one of the
individual orbs produced in the course of its evolution. Its
history is in kind like that which has been deciphered with
regard to the earth: it only carries the action of physical
forces, under a sustaining and directing hand, further back in
time.</p>

<p>The science also of Chemistry is aiding in the study of the
earth’s earliest development, and is preparing itself to write a
history of the various changes which should have taken place
among the elements from the first commencement of combination
to the formation of the solid crust of our globe.</p>

<p>It is not proposed to enter either into chemical or astronomical
details in this place, but, supposing the nebular theory to
be true, briefly to mention the great stages of progress in the
history of the earth, or those successive periods which stand
out prominently in time through the exhibition of some new
idea in the grand system of progress. The views here offered,
and the following on the cosmogony of the Bible, are essentially
those brought out by Professor Guyot in his lectures.</p>

<p><i>Stages of progress.</i>&mdash;These stages of progress are as follow:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) <i>The</i> <span class="smcap">BEGINNING OF ACTIVITY IN MATTER</span>.&mdash;In such
a beginning from matter in the state of a gaseous fluid the
activity would be intense, and it would show itself at once by
a manifestation of light, since light is a resultant of molecular
activity. A flash of light through the universe would therefore
be the first announcement of the work begun.</p>

<p>(2.) <i>The development of the</i> <small>EARTH</small>.&mdash;A dividing and sub-dividing
of the original fluid going on would have evolved
systems of various grades, and ultimately the orbs of space,
among these the earth, an igneous sphere enveloped in
vapors.</p>

<p>(3.) <i>The production of the</i> <span class="smcap">EARTH’S PHYSICAL FEATURES</span>,&mdash;by
the outlining of the continents and oceans. The condensible
vapors would have gradually settled upon the earth
as cooling progressed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span></p>

<p>(4.) <i>The introduction of</i> <span class="smcap">Life</span> <i>under its simplest forms</i>,&mdash;as
in the lowest of plants, and perhaps, also of animals. As
shown on page 396, the systems of structure characterizing
the two kingdoms of nature, the <i>Radiate</i> of the Vegetable
kingdom, and the <i>Radiate</i>, <i>Molluscan</i>, <i>Articulate</i>, and <i>Vertebrate</i>
of the Animal, are not brought out in the simplest forms
of life. The true <i>Zoic</i> era in history began later. As plants
are primarily the food of animals, there is reason for believing
that the idea of life was first expressed in a plant.</p>

<p>(5.) <i>The display of the</i> <span class="smcap">Systems</span> <i>in the Kingdoms of Life</i>,&mdash;the
exhibition of the four grand types under the Animal
kingdom, being the predominant idea in this phase of
progress.</p>

<p>(6.) <i>The introduction of the highest class of Vertebrates&mdash;that
of the</i> <span class="smcap">Mammals</span> (the class to which <span class="smcap">Man</span> belongs), viviparous
species, which are eminent above all other Vertebrates
for a quality prophetic of a high moral purpose,&mdash;that of
suckling their young.</p>

<p>(7.) <i>The introduction of</i> <span class="smcap">Man</span>,&mdash;the first being of moral and
intellectual qualities, and one in whom the unity of nature has
its full expression.</p>

<p>There is another great event in the Earth’s history which
has not yet been mentioned, because of a little uncertainty
with regard to its exact place among the others. The event
referred to is the first shining of the sun upon the earth, after
the vapors which till then had shrouded the sphere were
mostly condensed. This must have preceded the introduction
of the Animal system, since the sun is the grand source of
activity throughout nature on the earth, and is essential to
the existence of life, excepting its lowest forms. In the
history of the globe which has been given on page 196, it has
been shown that the outlining of the continents was one of
the earliest events, dating even from the Azoic age; and it is
probable, from the facts stated, that it preceded that clearing
of the atmosphere which opened the sky to the earth. This
would place the event between numbers 3 and 5, and as the
sun’s light was not essential to the earliest of organisms,
probably after number 4.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span></p>

<p>The order will, then, be&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) Activity begun,&mdash;light an immediate result.</p>

<p>(2.) The earth made an independent sphere.</p>

<p>(3.) Outlining of the land and water, determining the
earth’s general configuration.</p>

<p>(4.) The idea of life expressed in the lowest plants, and
afterward, if not contemporaneously, in the lowest or systemless
animals, or Protozoans.</p>

<p>(5.) The energizing light of the sun shining on the earth,&mdash;an
essential preliminary to the display of the systems of life.</p>

<p>(6.) Introduction of the system of life.</p>

<p>(7.) Introduction of Mammals, the highest order of Vertebrates,&mdash;the
class afterward to be dignified by including a
being of moral and intellectual nature.</p>

<p>(8.) Introduction of Man.</p>

<p><i>Cosmogony of the Bible.</i>&mdash;There is one ancient document
on cosmogony&mdash;that of the opening page of the Bible&mdash;which
is not only admired for its sublimity, but is very generally
believed to be of divine origin, and which, therefore, demands
at least a brief consideration in this place.</p>

<p>In the first place, it may be observed that <i>this document if
true, is of divine origin</i>. For no human mind was witness of
the events; and no such mind in the early age of the world, unless
gifted with superhuman intelligence, could have contrived
such a scheme;&mdash;would have placed the creation of the sun, the
source of light to the earth, so long after the creation of light,
even on the <i>fourth</i> day, and, what is equally singular, between
the creation of plants and that of animals, when so important to
both; and none could have reached to the depths of philosophy
exhibited in the whole plan.</p>

<p>Again, <i>If divine, the account must bear marks of human
imperfection, since it was communicated through man</i>. Ideas
suggested to a human mind by the Deity would take shape in
that mind according to its range of knowledge, modes of thought,
and use of language, unless it were at the same time supernaturally
gifted with the profound knowledge and wisdom adequate
to their conception; and even then they could not be
intelligibly expressed, for want of words to represent them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span></p>

<p>The central thought of each step in the Scripture cosmogony&mdash;for
example, Light,&mdash;the dividing of the fluid earth from the
fluid around it, individualizing the earth,&mdash;the arrangement
of its land and water,&mdash;vegetation,&mdash;and so on&mdash;is brought out
in the simple and natural style of a sublime intellect, wise for
its times, but unversed in the depths of science which the
future was to reveal. The idea of vegetation to such a one
would be vegetation as he knew it; and so it is described.
The idea of dividing the earth from the fluid around it would
take the form of a dividing from the fluid above, in the imperfect
conceptions of a mind unacquainted with the earth’s
sphericity and the true nature of the firmament,&mdash;especially
as the event was beyond the reach of all ordinary thought.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Objections are often made to the word “day,”&mdash;as if its use limited the
time of each of the six periods to a day of twenty-four hours. But in the course
of the document this word “day” has various significations, and, among
them, all that are common to it in ordinary language. These are&mdash;(1)
The light,&mdash;“God called the light day,” v. 5; (2) the “evening and the
morning” before the appearance of the sun; (3) the “evening and the
morning” after the appearance of the sun; (4) the hours of light in the
twenty-four hours (as well as the whole twenty-four hours), in verse 14;
and (5) in the following chapter, at the commencement of another record of
creation, the whole period of creation is called a “day.” The proper
meaning of “evening and morning,” in a history of creation, is <i>beginning
and completion</i>; and, in this sense, darkness before light is but a common
metaphor.</p>

<p>A Deity working in creation like a day-laborer by earth-days of twenty-four
hours, resting at night, is a belittling conception, and one probably
never in the mind of the sacred penman. In the plan of an infinite God,
centuries are required for the maturing of some of the plants with which
the earth is adorned.</p></blockquote>

<p>The order of events in the Scripture cosmogony corresponds
essentially with that which has been given. There was first a
void and formless earth: this was literally true of the “heavens
and the earth,” if they were in a condition of a gaseous fluid.
The succession is as follows:</p>

<p>(1.) Light.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span></p>

<p>(2.) The dividing of the waters below from the waters above
the earth, (the word translated <i>waters</i> may mean <i>fluid</i>.)</p>

<p>(3.) The dividing of the land and water on the earth.</p>

<p>(4.) Vegetation; which Moses, appreciating the philosophical
characteristic of the new creation distinguishing it from
previous inorganic substances, defines as that “which has seed
in itself.”</p>

<p>(5.) The sun, moon, and stars.</p>

<p>(6.) The lower animals, those that swarm in the waters, and
the creeping and flying species of the land.</p>

<p>(7.) Beasts of prey (“creeping” here meaning “prowling”)&mdash;</p>

<p>(8.) Man.</p>

<p>In this succession, we observe not merely an order of events,
like that deduced from science; there is a system in the
arrangement, and a far-reaching prophecy, to which philosophy
could not have attained, however instructed.</p>

<p>The account recognizes in creation two great eras of three
days each,&mdash;an <i>Inorganic</i> and an <i>Organic</i>.</p>

<p>Each of these eras opens with the appearance of <i>light</i>: the
<i>first</i>, light cosmical; the <i>second</i>, light from the sun for the
special uses of the earth.</p>

<p>Each are ends in a “day” of two great works,&mdash;the two
shown to be distinct by being severally pronounced “good.”
On the <i>third</i> “day,” that closing the Inorganic era, there was
first the <i>dividing of the land from the waters</i>, and afterward
the <i>creation of vegetation</i>, or the institution of a kingdom
of life,&mdash;a work widely diverse from all preceding it in the
era. Soon the <i>sixth</i> “day,” terminating the Organic era,
there was first <i>the creation of Mammals</i>, and then a second
far greater work, totally new in its grandest element, <i>the
creation of Man</i>.</p>

<p>The arrangement is, then, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>
1. <i>The Inorganic Era.</i><br />
<br />
1st Day.&mdash;LIGHT cosmical.<br />
<br />
2d Day.&mdash;The earth divided from the fluid around it, or<br />
individualized.<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
<br />
3d Day.&mdash;{ 1. Outlining of the land and water.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">{ 2. Creation of vegetation.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
2. <i>The Organic Era.</i><br />
<br />
4th Day.&mdash;LIGHT from the sun.<br />
<br />
5th Day.&mdash;Creation of the lower orders of animals.<br />
<br />
6th Day.&mdash;{ 1. Creation of Mammals.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">{ 2. Creation of Man.</span><br />
</p>

<p>In addition, the last day of each era included one work
typical of the era, and another related to it in essential points,
but also prophetic of the future. Vegetation, while, for
physical reasons, a part of the creation of the third day, was
also prophetic of the future Organic era, in which the progress
of life was the grand characteristic. The record thus accords
with the fundamental principle in history that the characteristic
of an age has its beginnings within the age preceding.
So, again, Man, while like other Mammals in structure, even
to the homologies of every bone and muscle, was endowed
with a spiritual nature, which looked forward to another era,
that of spiritual existence.&mdash;The <i>seventh</i> “day,” the day of
rest from the work of creation, is man’s period of preparation
for that new existence; and it is to promote this special end
that&mdash;in strict parallelism&mdash;the Sabbath follows man’s six
days of work.</p>

<p>The record in the Bible is, therefore, profoundly philosophical
in the scheme of creation which it presents. It is
both true and divine. It is a declaration of authorship,
both of Creation and the Bible, on the first page of the sacred
volume.</p>

<p>There can be no real conflict between the two Books of the
<span class="smcap">Great Author</span>. Both are revelations made by Him to
man,&mdash;the <i>earlier</i> telling of God-made harmonies coming up
from the deep past, and rising to their height when man
appeared, the <i>later</i> teaching man’s relations to his Maker,
and speaking of loftier harmonies in the eternal future.</p>

It may be useful once for all to inform the reader that the term <i>Rock</i>
is employed by Geologists in a technical sense. It is applied to every large
mass of mineral matter that goes to form the Crust of the Earth, whether
it be hard and strong, or soft and plastic. Thus, for example, gravel and
clay, coal and slate, are called <i>Rocks</i>, just as well as limestone and granite.
“Our older writers endeavored to avoid offering such violence to our language,
by speaking of the component materials of the Earth as consisting
of rocks and <i>soils</i>. But there is often so insensible a passage from a soft
and incoherent state to that of stone, that Geologists of all countries have
found it indispensable to have one technical term to include both, and in this
sense we find <i>roche</i> applied in French, <i>rocca</i> in Italian, and <i>felsart</i> in German.
The beginner, however, must constantly bear in mind, that the term rock
by no means implies that a mineral mass is in an indurated or stony condition.”&mdash;Lyell’s
Elements of Geology, p. 4.</p></div>

Carbonic acid gas contains two equivalents of oxygen to one of carbon,
the chemical expression for the compound being CO<sub>2</sub>; carburetted
hydrogen, which is the gas we employ in illuminating our streets and
houses, contains four equivalents of hydrogen to two of carbon, and is
chemically expressed by the symbols C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>; water is composed of one
equivalent of oxygen, and one of hydrogen, the symbolic form being HO.</p></div>

It would be more strictly correct to say that the rate of increase varies
considerably in different places, though the main fact is everywhere palpably
apparent that the deeper we descend into the Earth the higher the temperature
becomes. Sir Charles Lyell records a number of careful experiments
made in England, France, Germany, and Italy, which seem to show
that an increase of one degree Fahrenheit for every sixty-five feet of descent
would represent pretty correctly the general average. See his Principles of
Geology, vol. ii., pp. 205, 206.</p></div>

For the account of these various Earthquakes we are mainly indebted
to the indefatigable industry of Sir Charles Lyell, who has collected
the facts with great care partly from the descriptions of eye-witnesses,
and partly from authentic documents written upon the spot. See his
Principles of Geology, vol. ii., chap, xxviii., xxix., xxx. See also Mr.
Mallet’s Earthquake Catalogue; and the first of Sir John Herschel’s
Lectures on Familiar Subjects.</p></div>

The following are the sources from which we have chiefly derived
our information regarding the Peruvian Earthquake of 1868: (1) a series
of letters written upon the scene of the catastrophe, and published in
<i>The Times</i> of September 26, 1868; amongst them is one from the British
Vice-consul, and one from the agent of the Pacific Steam Navigation
Company, who were both at the time residents of Arica: (2) a letter of
Mr. Clements Markham in <i>The Times</i> of September 15, 1868: (3) Captain
Powell’s Report to the Admiralty, dated September 14, 1868.</p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
